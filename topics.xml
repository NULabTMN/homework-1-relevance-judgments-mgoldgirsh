        Escaping Gas in Boston Subway
        Works Great Havoc.
        HALF A HUNDRED INJURED

        aged Partial Liht of Dead and
        Disabled Accident Occurred ut
        Treuiunt and lloylbtoti Streets.
        Boston, March 4. An explosion lias just
        occurred in the subway excavation at the
        corner of Trcraont and Ooylston streets.
        Three electric cars that were passing
        at the time were wrecked and one ot
        them was burned. Several bulldingsin the
        vicinity were more or less damaged.
        The explosion was caused by escaping
        gas.
        Among the buildings damaged are the
        Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and
        Head buildings and the Masonic Temple.
        Window glass in buildings within 200
        feet of the scene of the explosion were
        shattered.
        At least twelve persons were killed.
        Four bodies have been removed to un
        dertaking' rooms.
        Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency
        Hospital.
        Among the dead are:
        Rev. W. A. Slack, professor at Tufts Col
        lege. G. I). Bigclow, conductor.
        Unknown man and woman.
        The injured include James Reardon, John
        J. O'Conuor, Thomas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R.
        Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F.
        W. Tceling, and Mrs. F. A. reck
        There seems to be no doubt thatatleast
        eight persons were immediately killed.
        The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars
        were almost in the ceutcr of the space at
        the corner.
        The first car was In the center when the
        explosion came. The whole of the wood
        work, which is used as a bridge over the
        subway, was lifted into the air, carrying
        the first car with it and taking along the
        two horses of the second car. The other
        Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air,
        but came down on the tracks. Instantly
        the air was filled with flying debris.
        The firat electric car, the one in which
        most or the killed were riding, no sooner
        reached the track than It broke in hair,
        and the whole portion Immediately burst
        into flame. Then someone sounded a fire
        alarm. This brought a large rescue force
        to the scene, and almost immediately calls
        were being sent out hurriedly for the am
        bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze
        of those who were first on the scene. In
        the center was the long blazing electric
        car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot
        the two horses killed instantly, and about
        ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where
        the woodwork of the car was blazing lay
        the dead and wounded people. Those who
        wore not injured in the cars on Boylston
        6treet were Incapable ot action
        at first, and people in the buildings and
        stores surrounding did not know what had
        occurred, but it did not take them long
        to secure their senses, and almost imme
        diately there was a rush to the assistance
        ot the wounded.
        It is stated that there was not a person
        on the three cars who was not injured, and
        all the wounds received were severe. Im
        mediately stores and offices were con
        verted into temporary hospitals until am
        bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome
        spectacle to see these bodies exposed on
        the sidewalks.
        Hose carriages were pressed into service
        as ambulances, and immediately they were
        started on their humane duty or getting the
        maimed to the hospitals.
        It Is supposed that-one of the dead women
        at Jones' undertaking rooms Is Mrs. A. M.
        Bates. She was out wlth a sister this
        morning and has not returned. The sister
        returned home slightly injurcd

        THE BOSTON SUBWAY
        SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
        STREET CAR PROBLEM.
        Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
        of the Uub Relieved by Underground |
        Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light, |
        Clean uud Attractive.
        It is now possible to cross Tromont
        street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
        Common and at any time of day without
        loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
        brought about tho change.
        It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
        Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
        the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
        At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
        urc very crooked and must of them aro
        very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
        lutionary times, but when the city grow
        miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
        self out to tho south and west; when busi?
        ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
        of Washington and Trentont streets, and
        when dozens of street car tracks usurped
        tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
        wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
        closely to the cow paths.
        Probably no other city on the continent,
        was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
        tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
        many yea: . . Some of tho most important
        street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
        cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
        Tremont streets. When I he chango was
        made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
        grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
        gle of overhead wires made that historic.
        breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
        green billiard cloth which had become fray?
        ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
        much wrangling in tho legislature and
        courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
        and put the trolley cars underground.
        A large portion of the work bus already
        lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
        ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
        ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
        Chicago or elsewhere is:
        "Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
        see?you huven't one in your place, have
        you?"
        It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
        anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
        open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
        subway. One Is out on Tremont street
        whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
        the tracks from each of those jmorough
        fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In
        the Public gardens, where the cars com?
        ing down Boylston street take tho under?
        ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly
        end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar?
        ket square and in front of the new Union
        terminal railroad station into which the
        Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern
        und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern
        DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin
        LIC <JAKl)i;X.
        ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their
        terminus, and, the subway being four
        tracked, they disgorge their passengers
        and take the back track up town.
        Including the inclines or open onto, tho
        subway has a total length of 1 % miles and
        will contain about live miles of track. At
        present the branch down Boylston street
        along the Common side and the main line
        down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
        ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
        tho northerly end of the main lino will be
        finished within the next eight months.
        Ground was broken for the subway in
        April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
        $7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
        transit commissioners say that it is proba?
        ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
        than that sum.
        No groat difficulties have been encoun?
        tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
        the ground. Of course there were count?
        less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
        wire conduits and the like und some -III
        inch water mains at an inconvenient level
        proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
        expected conditions arose to delay tho
        work. The main trunk of the subway
        runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
        east side of the Common, anil when the
        excavations were being made the bones of
        hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
        This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
        tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
        burying ground was harped upon for
        weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
        the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
        bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
        ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
        ment to mark the spot.
        The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
        Boylston street, where the south bound
        t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
        but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
        nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
        mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete
        and masonry. The roof is a series of
        arches und the floor Is concave, with
        drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are
        below the level of the sewers, jilts have
        been established at Intervals, and when
        thev are filled with water automatic elec?
        trical pumps are started, which empty
        them Into tho sewers above.
        Perhaps yon imagine that Bostons sub?
        way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It
        is nothing of the sort. The entrances to

        ?. The Boston subway ! short. That part now
        jkVM tense Is less than ft mile In length, and the
        KS farts which are under construction or proposed

        B9p The tunnel runs under Tremont street, and
        HHk Its extensions are to go under Cornhlll, Han
        JJ. oxer street, and Washington streot, passing
        i right through the denso business and shopping
        ) districts, and thus securing every advantage
        I that a road might have If It ran through Broad-
        jf ( Tray, Fourteenth street and Twenty-third street,
        i ( and part of Sixth avenue. And yet. In the face
        j ef all these advantages, three months' experi
        ence has shown that the Boston subway is not
        popular, that people will not go Into It ex-
        cept when they have to, and that the subway Is
        lv a failure, save so far as It was a necosslty to re-
        i'i Have the congestion of traffic on the street.
        V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT.
        A Bostonlans are proud of the subway. They
        ri take strangers to see It, just as they take them
        h to see Bunker IIIll Monument; make them ride
        vM the length of It back and forth, and call alien
        s' I tlon to all its fine foatures and then they keep
        & I away from it themsolves. Just as thoydofrom
        if ( the monument. That this result ls of tntorest
        I V to New Yorkers there can be no doubt. Tho
        ?; building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed
        -., Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need
        v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo
        in. facilities.
        Hien, about ten years ago. the West End
        oet Railway Company began to transform tho
        horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot
        lines the narrow streets In tho heart of
        iton were already choked with tho dally rush
        vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex
        stve and comprehensive electrlo car system
        the world. The added cars which wero re
        red for tho now service fairly filled
        i streets of the little central city
        ere they were all concentrated. These
        ' lines eorvo a suburban population of
        trly a million persons, and it is possible to
        ;e a car for any part of the territory covered
        .hoot going more thai a quarter of a mllo In .
        i city. Under a special act of the Lcglsla
        e the Boston Transit Commission was ap
        nted to devise a suitable means to relieve the
        Station.
        THE OrERATIVB COWTnAOT.
        fader this commission tho subway wns
        nned and is being built. Tho city of Boston
        s for it and leases it to tho West End Street
        llway Company for twenty years at an an
        il rental which is not to be less than 4Ts per
        it. upon the net cost of the tunnel, or more
        ,n .Ts per cent, upon tho sum of $7,000,000,
        he tunnol should cost so much, and tho com
        ly agrees to pay. in llou of interest, a toll of
        nts for each car that passes through the
        way. In caso the aggregate of tolls should
        :eed the interest charges. The railroad com
        ly cares for it, lights it, ventilates it, ana
        ips It free from wator. i
        fork was bosun on the subway on March 28,
        13, and on Sept. 1 of this rear the first scc
        o was put Into use. A second socllon was put
        o use on Sept. 30. The main part of tbo sub
        y now in use lies usdor Tremont street, bo
        sen Park street and Boylst:n street. This
        lion 'Is 1,700 feet long and contains four
        cks. At both ends aro stations, built
        nmodlously under ground and approached
        m the surface by wide, easy stair
        ye. wulch are protected by small or
        mental stone buildings. At the BoyI
        in street station the tunnel divides into
        o two-tracked sections. Ono of these con
        ues under Tremont street for about 1,200
        it, whon its comes to tho surfaco and empties
        cars upon the tracks in Tremont street and
        awmut avenue, which hero diverge. The
        ler branch turns sharply to the wostward,
        asunder the edge of tho famous Common, to
        Public Oarden beyond Ohnrles street, where
        comes to tho surfaco, 1,200 foet from the
        ylston streot station, and its cars goon tholr
        y down Boylston street,
        man standahd or coxsTitucnos.
        The tunnel Is kept almost as light as day
        im end to end. At the stations It ls lined on
        ) sides with enamelled white brick. Through
        t its length and on tho codings at tho
        itlons It Is pnlnted white. At tlio su
        ns and through the tunnol electric
        hts aro hung In abundance, and to make
        re that these shall not all fall at any ono tlnio
        5y are divided nnd fed by two scparato clr
        Its of wire, resides these lights, fixed In the
        itnel, are the lights In tho passing cars, which
        kept lit In making the tunnel passage. As
        oorthreocarsaro passing In each direction
        ery minute almost all the tliuo, their lights
        me would keep it fairly well illuminated.
        People doclare that they found the tunnel ro
        ishlngly cool during the warm woather In Sep
        nber Just after it was oponed, and In cold
        lather they find It warm. No winds penetrato
        and the moraont a porson gets to tho stairs at
        itatlon he Is out of rench of storms. Only ono
        jrce of discomfort has yet developed In tho
        e of the tunnel, and that. It U belloved,
        11 be remedied. This was, for the tlmo
        lasted, a very groat trouble. It occurred
        it month, when there had been a sudden
        ange of 25 or 30 degrees in temperature,
        oweathorhad been cold for thrco or four
        ys, and the ground and tho Inside of tho tun

        lllod roof and sides, and Immediately every
        log began to weep. The cold roof and sides of
        e tunnel condensed tho moisture In the
        irraer air, and In a short tlmo the
        jole Interior glistened with molsturu.

        BOSTON IMPROVEMENTS.
        Historic Landmarks and Crooked
        Streets Disappearing.
        Boston, June 20.— Within three years the
        crooks and turnings and devious wanderings of
        Boston's most honored highways and byways
        will be nothing more than a memory of the past,
        and many of her ancient landmarks will be
        wiped out or so altered as to be unrecognizable
        to the oldest inhabitant. Slowly and surely the
        ancient thoroughfares are being widened,
        straightened and bent into the rulerlike lines oC
        i rosscut New- York. Philadelphia and Chicago.
        Boston is undergoing a transformation below
        arid aloft that would cause Benjamin Franklin.
        John Hancock, "Warren and Paul Revere *.o rub
        their eyes and stare in amazement. Million dol
        lar buildings by the dozen, elevated roads, tun
        nels and streetcar lines beneath the streets and
        under the harbor, swamps and mud Hats filled
        !•: for piers and excavated for docks that ac
        > ':;iinodate giant steamers — these are the things
        they would see.
        Along State-st., beneath the spot where the
        Boston Massacre occurred, and beneath the his
        toric old State House, a tunnel is eating its way
        from under the harbor to Scollay Square to con
        nect with the present subway by means of
        (lights of stairs and elevators, and thence out
        side to the busy world. The old Slat- House
        itself is to be transformed into a tunnel station
        connecting with a subway line also. The re
        modelled building will soon be crowded with
        people hurrying back and forth, intent on busi
        ness, with never a thought of its old associa
        tions. Little do they think, as they hurry past
        where tunnel workmen are digsing seventy feet
        beneath, of what has happened In that quaint
        old edifice. On this site the first State House
        was built in 1G57. Destroyed by fire in 1711. it
        was rebuilt In 1712, and rebuilt again in 1747,

        No one know the trouble. Elevatcd
        road employes and offlclals were allke

        come next, fla tho smoko raphlly fllleil

        tempted to call the flrd departmont
        and found tho telephones so charged
        wlth clectrlclty as to be useless.
        Mnny of the women reachlng the
        subway by the Boylston street cars
        were overcomo by the smoko, falnted,
        nnd had to be dragged to the surfnce.
        Several becanio hysterlcal and woro

        danger belng constant of Bomeono
        falllng from tho platforms overcome
        by tho smoko and becomlng electro
        cuted upon the deadly thlrd rall.
        Tralnmaster Benjamln wns the flrst
        offlclal to reach the Boylston street
        statlon and to brlng some sort of or-
        der out of tho cliaos. Enterlng the
        subway along the llne of the north
        bound cars he made hla way some 100
        feet to the south of tlie statlon and
        found the cause of the trouble.
        . The feed cables for the thlrd rall,
        runnlng between the ralla and en
        closed ln four-inch wooden box con
        dults, were found grouuded and
        throwlng off flashes of electrlclty,
        whlch llluminnted the subway for
        tnany hundreds of feet. The electrl
        clty had jumped to other cables run
        nlng parallel, and even charged the
        wnlla of the subway. Ten powerful
        cables felt the lnftuence of the crosn
        nnd were cracklng nnd throwlng off
        flames and flashes of llght, threaten
        Ing death to any who cnme near.
        Tho wooden box condtilt, black and
        greasy and very Inflammable, was
        burnlng rapldly. A north bound traln
        whlch had passed over the spot got
        nflro nnd wna inillod bnnk lo Waont

        nnivth tho. .. Kttn"gulshed by'road
        employes before serlous damage was
        done.
        Three persons were hurt, nnd all of
        them were on the surface. The nccl
        dents whlch caused thelr Injurles were
        the dlrect result of the trouble In tbo
        subway. The Injured wero all near
        the Pleasant street entrance to tho
        Biibwny and were hurt by the explo
        sions in three mnnholes at tliat polnt.
        Tralnmaster Benjamln ordered all
        tralns Into statlons, and then the cnr-
        rent on the thlrd rall and feed cables
        was shut off.
        Chlef Mullcn and the flre depart
        ment hod been notlfled before tho
        power was shut off and entered tho
        nubway nt the Boylston street sta

        for anyone, however famlllar ylth the
        subway, to enter ln tlie dense smoke
        whlch flllcd every foot of space be
        tween the walls.
        As Chlef Mullen's men toucbed the
        walls thoy felt a shock at once. The
        brass nozzle of the chemlcal hose
        Ihey carrled became charged, and wlth
        electrlclty runnlng up thelr arms the
        men hcsltated for a mlnute for orders
        from thelr chlef.
        rlsk It," shouted Chlef Mull
        en, and he dashed Into the smoko
        filled subway. Hla men followed close
        behlnd, thelr hands on the shoulders
        of the men In front. A few darlng
        newspaper men brought up the rear.
        Half an hour was consumed ln put
        llng out the flames whlch had fol
        lowed nlong the box condults nearly
        300 ynrds.
        Both Chlef Mullen and Aaslstant
        Chlef Brady termed It one of the
        most dangerous flres they were ever
        called upon to hnndle, not from lts In
        tenslty but for the dangers of electro
        cutlon that surrounded them and the
        thlckness of the smoke.

        Lawson's Confidential Man
        Dies In Subway.
        Boston, Dec. 1. John F. Donohue,
        many years the confidential man of J.
        Edward Addicks aud of Thomas W.
        Lawsou, committed suicide by throw-!
        lng himself before a fast moving train ,
        in the subway. Deatli was install Ui- i
        neous.
        For about fifteen minutes Mr. Dono
        hue had been pacing the station plat
        form, walking to tho edge and looking
        down at the rails and peering up and
        down the track. Just before a north
        bound train drew up Mr. Donohue
        dropped a light cane lie had been car
        rying and jumped into the train pit
        His family furnished no explanation
        for the act. Friends say he had been
        suffering from stomach trouble about
        a year. He was sixty years old and a
        native of Ireland and for a time was
        engaged lu shoe manufacturing In
        Lynn, Mass.

        BOSTON'S SUBWAY, SURFACE AND ELEVATED LINES
        PRACTICALLY TIED UP BY STRIKE
        Boston, June 7. By noon to
        day the surface, elevated and sub
        way car system of Boston and
        suburbs was utterly disorganized.
        A strike of the union employes
        of the Boston Elevated, which
        controls the surface and subway
        lines, was called at 4:15 o'clock
        this morning after a stormy three
        hour session at union headquar
        ters. The elevated officials laughed
        at the strike. When the union was
        formed only a few weeks ago the
        elevated set about a counter or
        ganization, a "protective" asso
        ciation they called it.
        This morning the officials of
        the company claimed they had
        2,000 men in this protective asso
        ciation who would continue to
        work, and that they had 1,500
        strike-breakers already imported
        from New York and Philadelphia.
        There was a good deal of riot
        ing after the strike was called.
        Cars wer.e stoned, trolleys discon
        nected, motormen and conductors
        who refused to recognize the
        strike order roughly handled,
        le,epers were put on the tracks,
        and cautious Bostonians walked
        to work this morning.
        But the rioting never became
        very serious and it was not neces
        sary. As the forenoon wore on
        motormen after motormen, and
        conductor after conductor left
        their 'packed cars standing'in the
        street and went to union head
        quarters to report.
        Even wherfe they did not leave
        the cars there always was some
        one to disconnect the trolley
        wires. Then the motormen and
        conductors would refuse to get
        off to fix it, and the police would
        have to do it.
        Because the guards at the
        Park street terminal of the Cam-
        bridge subway reported to the
        union the escalators were stopped
        and passengers had to climb three
        flights of stairs to the street.
        There are 3,800 members of the
        union. The strike was called be
        cause :
        The company refused to recog
        nize the union; announced it
        would employ no union .men.
        When complaints were made
        against men, they were laid off
        without pay pending a hearing.
        If exonerated and reinstated,
        the pay they lost never was made
        up. i
        Conductors were forced to fur
        nish $10 change for each trip.
        Despite the company's refusal
        of an increase because their
        "finances wquld not stand it,"
        the "loyal federation or protec
        tive asspciation" members' pay
        was increased when the union
        was formed.
        Police Commissioner O'Meara
        ordered all the reserves on duty
        at the subway and elevated, sta
        tions and car barns this forenoon.
        There already have been fifty arm
        rests, but all the cases were con
        tinued until oMnday.

        in the Boston subway, even the old?

        "How do you ever know where to
        go?" I asked my mother, who has a
        pretty good bump of location.
        "I don't know," she replied. "No?

        these were made of cloth with

        Tbe Boston Subtvay.
        The opening of the new subway-railroad
        in Boston is an event which cannot fail
        to have a most important and abiding
        influence on city and suburban rapid
        transit development in America, says the
        Chicago "Record.” The idea of the
        underground railroad, which is firmly
        established in European favor, has met
        with sturdy opposition on this side of
        the water, and the mention of the "hole
        in the ground,” its dangers and its
        murky and vitiated air, is quite familiar
        to those interested in the subject of
        rapid transit. In the face of the success
        —already spoken of as assured—of the
        Boston electric underground road, the
        force of this opposition must diminish
        daily. The experience of Europe that
        the underground electric railroad is, in
        many cases, the easiest way out of the
        rapid-transit, difficulty, promises to be
        amply confirmed in the United States
        The tracl</ in Boston are twenty-three
        and thirty-nine feet below the surface,
        but the public, far from showing any
        fear of traveling underground, throngs
        the platforms, and the cars carry full
        loads steadily. The interior of the sub
        way is lighted and finished in white.
        On the first day the ventilating fans
        were not In operation, and yet it is said
        “the air seemed as fresh as on the street."

        Boston's rapid transit system is now fully completed, and it not only
        affords that city ample facilities for interurban pnssenger traffic, but has
        actually added to tlie architectural beauty of the Hub, as may be seen in
        the above picture. This view shows the Scollay square station, where
        passengers go down to take the trains which run first underground and thoD
        on an elevated structure.

        BOSTON'S SUBWAY. 1
        Work on Boston's line subway is progres
        sing even during eld weather. Modern
        methods of engineering overcome easily
        seeming obstacles and already a section
        directly under Tremont street near Park
        Street church is comuleted. The subway
        is no longer a problem; it can be accepted
        as a settled fact that the work will be vigor
        ously pusned to its completion.

        HOW, BOSTON SOLVED PROBLEM.
        The city of Boston is slightly smaller than
        Philadelphia, yet the far-famed "Hub"
        has 26.5 miles of high speed service of
        which &8 nro underground. Besides tho
        subway service Boston has 17.7 miles of
        elovated service. The elevated runs
        somewhat in the form of a circle and
        connects the city itself with Charles
        town. The Boston elevated is said by many
        to bo antiquated, yet Its eftlclency la well
        known to transit experts of the country.
        The Boston subway which connects with
        East Boston and especially tho service
        from Park street to Harvard square Is
        said to be one of the best systems In the
        country.
        The efficiency of a service cannot bo
        Judged perhaps from the earnings of that
        service. In fact In some cases the fig
        ures are misleading.
        The Boston Elevated Railroad Com
        pany, which takes In all branches of tho
        cervlce, Is well known ns a good, live,
        money making concern. From 1902 to 19U
        Inclusive It has paid nn annual dividend
        of 6 per cent. The annual gross earnings
        have Increased In nine years more than
        $1,000,000.
        . The necessity for high-speed lines In
        Boston arose principally from the extreme
        tffl t S,iia4i.
        contrition in the narrow street of the
        principal business district. In 1893 n par
        tial solution of tills problem was under
        taken by tho construction of n subway
        for surface cars under Boylston and
        iremont streets, xvlilcli was completed m
        liOS.
        This was followed by tho construction
        of a high-speed system, consisting of an
        elevated Hue extending two miles to the
        najth nnd nn elevated line extending
        three miles to the southwest, both ron
        ncetlnB with a loop, which Inclosed the
        principal district and connected the two
        large rnlltond terminals,
        The cast side of this loop Is on an
        elevated structure running along tho
        water front, and two of the Tremont
        street tracks of the original subway
        were used temporarily for the west side.
        A subway nbout one mile long wns then
        constructed under tho principal business
        street, and this Is now used permanently
        for thiougli operation of tho elevated
        lines to the north nnd south.
        The elevated line to the south has been
        extended to a distance of live miles from
        the centre, and It Is proposed to extend
        the northern
        distance.
        arm to about tho same
        TUNNELED UNDER HARBOR.
        A tunnel has also been dilvcn under
        the harbor to East Boston, extending In
        to tho heart of tho business district,
        here connection Is made with tho north
        nnd south line. Special type cars nro
        operated singly In this tunnel and run
        out on to the surface lines In East Boa
        ton. Within the past year n subway line
        running nbout three miles westward to
        Cambridge has been put tn operation.
        Standard rapid transit service is main
        tained In this subway. An extension of
        this line eastward through the business
        district, and thenco southward for a dis
        tance of nbout two miles, has been au
        thorized and is In process of construc
        tion. An elevated lino for surfaco cars ex
        tends about a mllo to the northwest, and
        an extension of the subway for surface
        cars on Boylston street Is In courso of
        construction to a point two miles from
        City Hall.
        All underground construction was un
        dertaken by the city, while all of the
        elevated construction belongs to the
        operating company, which also owns nnd
        operates practically all of the surface
        system. All of the high-speed lines have
        elaborate terminals for the transfer of
        passengers to and from surfaco cars. This
        method of transfer Is the most Important
        feature of Boston's rapid transit Bystem.
        Transit Program in Brief
        The transit program provides for the
        operation of all high-speed lines In
        conjunction with the surface system,
        which will serve as the agent for the
        gathering and distributing of Pn
        gers using the high-speed lines with
        out txtra charge.

        MANY CHERRY TREES
        SHIPPED BY MIKADO
        JAPAN SENDS U. S. OVER 2000
        FINE SPECIMENS -
        Many Saplings from Orient Will B«
        Planted Along Potomac and Riv
        erside Driveways — Mrs.
        Taft Recipient
        WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.—When tha
        honorary commercial commissioners of
        Japan arrives in Washington, Novem
        ber 1, they will be taken on an auto
        mobile ride which will include Poto
        mac drive, along which 2000 cherry
        trees to be presented to this country
        by the emperor of Japan are to be
        planted.
        The shipment of the trees and the
        planting thereof have been entrusted
        to Toraklro Watase, proprietor of a
        Tokio plant and seed company, who
        is one of the commissioners.
        Speaking of the gift of the emperor
        to the city of Washington, Mr. Watase
        said the trees would be sent to Mrs.
        Taft, wife of the president, and by
        her presented to the government for
        transplanting- along- Potomac drive.
        Former President Roosevelt and
        President Taft are chiefly responsible
        for the improvement of the Potomac
        river front, and it was Mrs. Taft ivho
        gave the name Potomac park to that
        section of the city. She made popular
        the afternoon promenades on the drive,
        which were a feature last year of
        summer life in the capital.
        New York Remembered
        The emperor of Japan Is sending to
        New York also a large number of
        cherry trees to be planted along River
        side drive and Grant's tomb.
        In Japan, the land of the cherry
        blossom, there are many beautiful
        legends about the trees and flower of
        the cherry.
        The blossom of the Japanese cherry
        is of a peculiarly delicate beauty, and
        there is a tradition in Japan that if
        that same tone appears in the blos
        soms of the Japanese cherry planted
        in another country, that country can
        he taken and subjugated by Japan.
        Mr. Watase is authority for the
        statement that while many Japanese
        cherry trees have been brought to the
        United States, the color of the bloa
        eoms, although just as beautiful, is
        unlike the blossom which appears in
        Japan.
        •Therefore," he said, "we conclude
        that we could not take America, even
        if we were so disposed."

        TO DESTROY JAPANESE TREES.
        Gifts from Tokio to Wasnington Found
        To Be Badly Diseased.
        Washington, Jan. 2S.— Regret has been
        expressed by the President and by Mrs.
        Taft because two thousand Japanese
        cherry trees presented b> the municipality
        of Toklo to this government for use In the
        national capita' have been found to be
        Ir.fected with root gall worms, certain dis
        eases and Insect pests, some of the latter
        hitherto unknown in this country. The
        trees were to have been planted in Poto
        m;\c Park, wl^.ich Mrs. Taft did much last
        year to have made the outdoor boulevard
        and meeting place of social \\ ashington.
        The Secretar of Agriculture s.,- .m
        It necessary to recommend the destruc
        tion of the trees. Secretary Knox lias ex
        ptm ■ i to the Japanese Ambassador the
        regret of the government authorities that

        Down at the Tidal Basin, the other
        side of the Monument, a galaxy of
        Japanese cherry trees are Is full and
        fragrant bloom blooms that are try
        Ing to say with U. their delicate
        pinkness and sweetness that -spring
        Is here, that they live "but to weave
        garlands for her costumes and
        wreath lor her hair.
        Yesterday every member of the
        Japanese embassy made a pilgrimage
        to the- cherry trees from their own
        far-away country stood In wonder
        and delight at the sight of the flowers
        they love so well. It was like being
        transported "back to Japan for a few
        happy moments, they said.
        But it's only a sample of what
        Japan really looks like, they declare,
        for In their country the trees are tea
        times as big as our trees, although
        not a whit lovelier, for the climate
        here Is ideal for the full flowering of
        the- Japanese trees.
        Th cherry trees' came tc as
        straight from Japan several years
        ago and begged a home in this jeeaa
        try. What could be, more appro
        priate for a dwelling' place than the
        National Capital and what more, de
        lightful and easily accessible location
        than that around the Tidal Basin
        So they- were planted and took new
        coot and life and every sprfng 'will
        display more profuse and lovelier
        charms
        It was the city of Tokyo, throcxh
        the mayor, which made It possible. fpr
        Washingtonlans to have a glimpse of
        Japan as it looks in the unforgettable
        springtime, which has1 always' been
        the Inspiration of poets arid loyers.
        Thousands of miles away' little
        Japanese maidens plight their troth
        under the cherry trees, and Just to
        demonstrate that maidens of every
        time and clime are not very much, un
        like, alm&st any bright, sunshiny day
        can find little American maidens
        walking- hand and nand with very
        American boys under the- rtrr same
        kind of trees, saying the very same
        kind of things that the cherry blos
        soms have heard for centuries is
        their own country.

        On April 4, ll>oo. exactly a month]
        ; after coming to the White House to live.
        Mrs. Taft had the tlrst eighty trees

        CRES OF FtOWERS ON THE EDWARD FENWICK FARM.
        Cherry Blooms Unique D. C. Institution
        BY WILLIAM S. ODLIN.
        Kwan Tan, Shira Yuki and Jo-
        Nioi are back again! It* is
        cherry-blossom time along
        the Potomac, and the good
        citizens of the National Capi
        tal are at the height of an annual
        period of ecstasy. Cherry blossoms
        sltc on every tongue, the glory of the
        spectacle is confided to every ear, and
        all eyes feast on cherry-blossom
        beauty.
        • If the visitor is an entire stranger
        and stopping at a hotel and seeking
        guidance from porter, clerk or taxi
        tnan, even the most dour will suggest
        a view of the cherry blossoms as the
        take off In the round of sightseeing.
        Busses alter their routes so that-their
        patrons may see the blooms, and the
        claekety-clack of the handful of red
        wlieoted, open-faced carriages that
        sire romantic survival of an elder
        Washington, mingles with the roar
        cherry trees aro the first objective
        drives that aro bordered by the cherry
        trees.
        Before the visitor departs attrac
        tively and more or less accurately
        tinted photographs have been dis
        patched back home or carefully
        gtowed in the luggage.
        The history of the cherry blossoms
        «f Washington is a record of failure
        and success, and finally undisputed
        triumph. Their hold upon the affec
        tions. not only of the Capital, but of
        persons who have visited here in
        ring, is irrefutable denial of some
        %vhn would have it that materialism
        dominates the-age, and that desert air
        Is ail that welcomes the beauty im

        EARLY BLOOMS
        UPSET CHERRY
        FETE PROGRAM
        Petals in Full Glory
        Os Color Today
        Making the best of a very pretty
        situation. District officials and
        businessmen today were busy with
        efforts to get their plans caught
        up with the cherry blossoms.
        With fine disregard for man
        made schedules, the pink petals
        exploded in all their glory in the
        heat of summer around the Tidal
        Basin yesterday.
        150,000 EXPECTED
        The standard fanfare for this
        annual event had to be scrapped.
        No queen of the festival, jio
        parade, no grand stands. The city
        fathers, in solemn conclave, pro
        claimed this as Cherry Blossom
        Time, now and for so long as the
        buds last.
        Press wires burned the floral
        news across the country, and Sun
        day is expected to see 150,000
        extra persons in Washington for
        the spectacle.
        Weather Bureau officials said
        today’s 80-degree maximum tem
        perature would be shoved down to
        around 60 by sporadic showers to
        night. At noon the mercury
        touched 77.

        No flower has entered Japanese history, litera J
        ture, art and religious thought longer or more
        richly than our sokura or Japanese cherry. It
        was only natural, therefore, that foreign visitors
        to Uils country began to coll It the land of cherry
        blossoms and that we have chosen sakura as our
        national flower by common consent. Our army has
        adopted the blossom ns Its Insignia as an expres
        sion of the national Ideal of always being ready
        to die for a cause, after the manner of sakura,
        which falls In the height of natural glory and
        human admiration without the slightest desire to
        linger In the sordid world. From Herald of Asia.

        Bnuona Tor Believing that the Planet is
        Inhabited.
        The conditions which favor the blief
        in the existence of life in the planet
        Mars present the clearest possible evi
        dence ot being one in origin and structure
        with our own earth. We cannot tell
        wnat the nature of the soil of Mars may
        be, but its generally ruddy tince so
        well marked that, though the telescope
        shows an almost equal part of the surface
        to be greenish in hue, the red prevails,
        giving to the planet, as seen by the naked
        eye, its obvious red color eee'ms to show
        that it resembles the red sandstone of
        our own earth. This, we know, is one of
        tne oiaer geological tormations, and if we
        could safely compare terrestrial with
        Martian geology, or, let us say, geology
        with aerology, we might almost be
        tempted to find in the present prevalence
        of a tint belonging to one of the earlier
        of our terrestrial formation an argument
        in favor of the theory that Mars passed
        through fewer stages of development
        during its life bearing condition than
        on r earth, and that thus the later forma
        tions of our earth's surface are wanting
        in the surface of Mars. This reasoning
        would not be very safe, however, it im
        plies a resemblance in details which is
        not likely, the observed rule of nature
        seeming so far as we can judge, to be
        similarity in generals, variety in details.
        We may well believe that the ruddiness
        of the soil of Mars is due to the same
        general cause as the ruddiness of our
        red sandstone the general prevalence of
        certain organisms but neither the actual
        character of this particular formation,
        nor its position in the territorial series of
        strata can be safely predicted of the
        ruddy formation constituting the chief
        part of the visible land surface of Mars.
        Few will now suppose with a French
        writer that the ruddiness of Mars is due
        to the color of the vegetation there. A
        certain support is given to the idea by.
        the circumstance that the degree ot rud
        diness is variable, and is somewhat
        greater during the Martain summer than
        in spring and autumn. In this sense we
        may say of the summer of Mars with the
        poet Wendell Holmes :
        The snows that glittered on the disc of Mars
        Have melted, and the planet's fiery ob
        Bolls in the crimson summer of its year.
        But the ruddiness of the planet's sum
        mer which will be well marked this
        year, for on September 18, only eleven
        days after its time of nearest approach
        and greatest splendor, it will be mid
        summer's day lor the southern half of
        Mara can be otherwise and better ex
        plained than by supposing that the
        Martian forests glow with fiery foliage
        during the summer days. We can see,
        as the summer proceeds, the white mists
        which had hidden the planet's lands and
        seas breaking up, and the features of the
        surface being gradually revealed with
        more and more distinctness. It is to the
        disappearance of these mists and clouds,
        not to the red leaves of Martian trees,
        that the change in the plant's color must
        most probably be referred. We have less
        reason for doubt as to the nature of the
        greenish markings. The spectroscope, as
        we have already explained in "Life in
        Mars," shows that the air of Mars is at
        times laden heavily with the vapor of
        water. We can no longer, therefore,
        follow Wbewell in doubting the real na
        ture of the green parts of the planet, or
        refuse with him to accept explanation of
        the white polar marking long since ad
        vanced by Sir W. Herschel. Undoubt
        edly wide seas and oceans, with many
        straits and bays and inland seas, exist on
        Mars. Snow and ice gather in the win
        ter time about his polar regions, dimin
        ishing gradually in extent as summer
        proceeds, but never entirely disappearing.
        Thus we are not left doubtful as to the
        general resemblance of Mars, so tar as the
        structure of his surface is concerned, to
        the earth on which we live. He has a
        surface of earth, probably in large part
        formed by deposition at the bottom of
        former seas and subsequently raised
        above the sea level by subterranean forces,
        or rather caused to appear above the
        surface by the effects of the gradual
        shrinkage of the planet's crust.

        How Life in Mars Goes On.
        In the case of the planet liars, and in
        the case of the planet Mars -alone, oar
        astronomers have really established the
        existence of a similarity of physical con
        dition, which gives us the strongest posi
        tive grounds for inferring that even such
        creatures as we now are could somehow
        make shift to live there, though, of course,
        not without a certain amount of preli
        minary discomfort while we were trying to
        acclimatize ourselves. Mr. Proctor's
        graphic account f these similarities, and
        his delightful chart of the planet's conti
        nents and waters, suggests to ub to discuss
        one or two of the known differences of
        condition, in their relation to the probable
        results upon the history and civilization of
        the Martialists.
        First, let us briefly say that the Mar
        tialista have a world less in area than one
        of our hemispheres to explore ; that, in
        spite of this, it has not much less land than
        the earth, a much less proportion of its
        surface being occupied with water than of
        our globe ; its seas are of the general type
        of tne Baltic and Mediterranean, for the
        most part narrow, straggling, inland seas ;
        jthe greatest seas are in the neighborhood
        of the cold south pole of Mars, which has
        a climate far severer than the north pole ;
        there is a world of perpetual snow at tach
        Martial pole, which can be seen to diminish
        as the summer returns to each hemisphere,
        and to increase again as winter comes
        back; and, in spite of the prepon
        derance of land, a vast deal of rain falls on
        Mars, especially in winter, clouds often
        hiding the configuration of the continents
        from our astronomers, and the suddenly
        dispersing, and leaving the continents clear
        again a clearing up which usually happens
        about the hour of noon-in Mars, just as
        our weather so often changes as the sun
        passes the meridian ; that the length of the
        Martial year is nearly twice as long as
        ours; and that the force of gravity on
        Mars is much less than half what it is with
        us, so that, as Mr. Proctor expresses it, fa
        Daniel Lambert on Mars would be able to
        leap easily to a height of five or six feet,
        and he could run faster than the best of
        our terrestrial athletes."
        The general result, then, of the tele
        scopical observations on Mars, and the de
        duced calculations, may be said to be :
        (1.) With certainty, that the' weight of
        objects of the same mass in Mars is much
        less than half what it is here, and that
        consequently there would be a far greater
        range of activity for creatures of the same
        size, that falls would be less dangerous,
        that the strain on walls or columns, or any
        other supports, would be much less ; and
        that, therefore, roofs, arches and struc
        tures of that kind might be easily set up
        on a much larger scale by creatures of
        equal skill with ourselves; but, on the
        other hand, that friction, which is more or
        less proportional to - pressure, and,
        fore, in the case of piles of
        stones, etc, to weight, would be far less
        than on the surface of the earth, so that
        any violent lateral disturbances, such as
        hurricanes, would exert a still greater ef
        fect than on our earth in destroying such
        structures, since there would be less solid
        ity and, therefore, less fractional resistance
        to overcome in overturning them. Again,
        the vastly diminished weight of given
        masses would give a very great advantage
        to all kinds of engines of draught Car
        riages, carts and railways would attain a
        vastly greater speed than on our earth, and
        the sledging on the snow-fields of Mars
        might be as swift as the wind. All these
        inferences are matters of certainty, so far
        as they go.
        But (2) there seems a very great proba
        bility that the atmosphere of Mars is re
        latively considerable denser than ours,
        since at a distance from the sun so much
        greater that the planet probably receives,
        directly, less than half the light and heat
        we receive. There seems no sign of any
        arctic severity, and clear evidence that the
        atmosphere holds vast quantises of watery
        vapr, even in winter, which points to a
        temperature much higher than our world
        would have if removed to the same dis
        tance from the sun, especially when one
        considers how much less water to supply
        vapor, and how much greater a propor
        tion ot iana man tne earth Mars contains.
        Again, the rapidity with which storms
        clear off from a big continent, and leave
        the outlines clearly marked after being all
        enveloped in mist before, seems to show
        the existence of very rapid currents of air;
        and this no doubt the greater inclination
        of the axis of Mars, giving a greater range
        to the northward and southward journeys
        of the sun, would promote. Putting these
        facts together, then, we 6hould infer that
        tne atmosphere of Mars is, in proportion,
        heavier than that cf the earth, and there
        fore a wanner envelope for the planet ;
        that its winds are more violent, and that
        the great difficulty of the architects of the
        planet is more likely to be the strengthen
        ing of their structures against lateral forces
        hurricanes, for instance than against
        me buiuu 01 gravity. ineir outer walls
        would hav,e to be comparatively much
        more solid ; their difficulty in rising broad
        arches and spacious roofs would be much
        less; and locomotion on Mars must be
        more easy and speedy, eeterit paribus, than
        wcumouou on eann.
        If this be so, we may see a fitness in the
        much larger proportion of land in the
        planet, and the comparative narrowness
        ana smauness ot the s as. Probably life
        in Mars is faster than it is here. It is very
        improbable that the civilization of the dif
        ferent continents there, is divided by peri
        ods extending over two thousand years.
        There is probably no one of the great con
        tinental tracts 01 aiars Known there as
        " the New World." If great migrations
        of conquering races have taken place on
        Mars, as on the earth, they have probably
        uruHi eacn otner iaster, Having a less
        surface to move over, less obstacles, per
        haps, in the way, and greater advantages
        in locomotion. We should not be sur
        prised, too, if the Martialists had got
        greatly ahead of us in resDect of n a vi rat
        ing the air. We know that the density of
        Ilia 1 1 J . . . . J
        puwcb, as wuuie, lit jess man inree
        fourths of tnat of our earth; so that it
        seems uaeiy inai me tissues of the body
        of a Martialist, which must be fed from
        the substance of the planet, are. on the
        whole, intrinsically lighter than those of
        man s ooay. But, u the Martialists' bodies
        are intrinsically lighter, and their atmos
        phere a good deal heavier than ours, aerial
        transit may be a very easy matter to them,
        and it is quite conceivable that their
        normal mode of locomotion may be through
        the air.
        Again, if we are right in supposing the
        currents of air in Mars to be of more than
        usual violence, while the solidifying force
        of friction which resists them is much
        smaller than here, it may be a reasonable
        inference that " natural selection" has al
        ready weeded out the loftier growing trees,
        which would stand less chance in encount
        ers with hurricanes than our own ; and it
        is not improbable that the tendency of the
        greater facilities for motion, and the great
        er velocity of life in Mars altogether,
        would be that all its animal inhabitants
        range wider for their food, and obtain less
        on a given area than on our earth.
        We should be disposed to conjecture
        that it is a world in which speed is greater
        and of more importance than even on the
        earth ; and, if so, it seems likely enough
        that the difficulty we have supposed as to
        the solidity of walls exposed to the atmos
        pheric currents of Mars is got over as the
        difficulty of building durable structures is
        generally got over in our own tropics,
        where earthquakes are so common by not
        building durable structures at all, but only
        very light and fragile ones a process
        which would, of course, be much easier
        where all the materials were lighter and
        all motion swifter than with us. In a
        word, it seems likely that the distinctive
        feature of life on Mars is velocity; that
        the creatures there live faster, move often
        er, undergo more change just as the
        planet itself passes through a far vaster
        orbit (though its orbital velocity is not
        quite so great as ours) in one of the
        Martial years. But that such a character
        istic would tend to quicken the progress
        of the mind and of discovery is doubtfuL
        With us civilization has never advanced
        rapidly till it had become tame and, so to
        say, plodding, and the excitements of local
        change, at least, had become few. But
        the great seasonal changes of Mars es
        pecially in the southern hemisphere, where
        the winter and summer are aggravated by
        the enormously increased distance of the
        sun at that period when his rays are least
        direct, and his nearness at that period
        when his rays are most direct contribute
        to confirm the impression we have drawn
        from other considerations that physically.
        at least, the lite tnere nas lar more oi
        rapid change in it than we can easily con
        ceive ; but whether that has developed or
        arrested the mental and moral progress of
        the Martialists is a question of which the
        elements are altogether too conjectural for
        serious discussion.

        PLANET mars and its hen
        jocb Discussion as to tbe Lights and
        Marks on the Planet.
        ^semblances Between Mars and Earth
        _We Cannot Tell Tet About the
        Men Theré.
        Are the people on the planet
        Mars trying to signal the earth?
        That is the question which the
        work of the great Lick telescope
        during the past few days has
        aroused, as Mars has approached
        nearer and nearer to the big Cali
        fornia instrument, wTiich will soon
        have opportunities for observation
        sueh as were never known before
        in the history of astronomy.
        This may be the explanation of
        the Btrange phenomena observed
        this week at the Lick observatory.
        The results thus far obtained have
        already been so extraordinary as
        to have made profound impression
        upon the practical minds of the
        astronomers there assembled.
        Three great lights, forming a tri
        angle, have been seen in the south
        western limb of the planet. They
        had never been seen before, in any
        observations.
        There was no mistake about
        these lights. They were seen for
        four nights in succession, so that it
        was impossible that they could
        have been produced by conditions
        of the earthly or Martian atmos
        pheres or have been optical delu
        eions ot any kind. Wnen first
        seen at the Lick observatory, these
        lights in a triangle so astonished
        the astonomers that they believed
        them to be the effect of light uncon
        nected with the planet. They
        therefore, with true astronomical
        caution, waited until the following
        night before devoting much thought
        to the lights. On the second night,
        however, which was even more
        clear and brilliant than the first,
        the lights were Been to be there
        when the great polished lens was
        turned upon the orb which had
        itepped to its place in the sky.
        For two succeeding evenings
        after that these lights were ob
        served, burning steadily, brilliantly
        and effulgently, as if from three
        mountain tops. It was evident
        that the lights were placed upon
        mountains in Mars or artificial
        projections or elevations of some
        kind.
        The appearance of three brilliant
        lights in a triangle upon one of tbe
        plaiiets in a manner the astrono
        mers are unable to explain raises a
        presumption at which their minds
        recoil. A scientist would, when
        thoroughly convinced of the exist
        ence of these light under such con
        ditions as are known to prevail in
        Mars, easily glide to the almost
        irresistible conclusion that they
        were the work of the men on
        MarB.
        Observed at any other time
        there would be apparently no other
        mean of explaining these lights in a
        way satisfactory to common sense
        Observed at the present time, whon
        eminent men in science have
        reached the conclusion that the
        people on Mars would seize tho
        opportunity to try again to attract
        the attention of people on the earth
        the three lights on Mars are as
        significant as the moving lights in
        the diBtanco were to Columbus on
        his caravel.
        Hut tho the three strange lights
        which have looked down tho 3b
        incli tube of the Lick telescope for
        four successive nights and astound
        ed the astronomers at the other end
        art- not the only unusual appear
        ances upon the surface of the
        planet which the great piece of
        Hint glass has revealed. That
        glass, which cost over $50,000 and
        at
        took years to select, grind and
        polish until perfection was attained,
        has re waled things which other
        observatories have not noticed dur
        ing the present opposition.
        The people of Mars being able to
        bridge this globe which we call
        Earth so close to them that they
        can see forests, fields and cities, if
        indeed, they cannot actually see
        people walking on the streets,
        would be eager to establish com
        munication with us. They may
        have tried to do this for centuties
        at each recurring opposition of
        Mars, or opposition of the Earth,
        as they would call it, and repeated
        failures would only stir them to
        greater efforts.
        The light» suddenly went out,
        though, at different times of the
        four nights when they were seen.
        It almost seemed as if they were
        supplied by an electric current and
        as if the current had been shut off,
        so suddenly did they disappear.
        Amazement struck the observers
        when first the lights went out.
        They reflected that, of course, the
        lights were some atmospheric effect
        on the rim of Mar* and the very
        fact of their strange disappearance
        tended to prove this. The next
        night, however, the three Btrange
        lights flashed out in the same
        place as soon as darkness had set
        in and after showing steadily for a
        few hours they vanished.
        SchiaparelU was the first person
        to give definite basis upon which
        to rest the belief that Mars was
        inhabited by a highly civilized
        race. He discovered that the sur
        face of the planet was intersected
        by a large number of canals.
        Primarily, Flammarion based
        his theory upon that of Schiaparelli
        and the two run in together in
        many places, being to a large ex
        tent identical. He showed plainly
        that there was water upon the
        planet, and there was little doubt,
        he said, that the inhabitants of
        Mars very closely resembled those
        ot the earth.
        Thus, in considering the subject
        of opening up communication with
        the Martians Flammarion has de
        voted much thought to a possible
        method of signals which might be
        devised upon the earth. He has
        said: "A triangle, traced in lumi
        nous lines on MarB* surface, each
        side from twelve to fifteen kilome
        tres long, would be visible from
        here by the aid of our telescopes.
        It follows then that a triangle,
        square or circle of the dimen
        sions stated, constructed upon
        a vast plain of the earth by
        means of luminous points, reflected
        in the daytime by solar light and
        ligted at night by electicity, would
        be visible to the astronomers of
        Mars if there are such astronomers
        and if they have optical instruments
        as good as our own.
        Tracing this illustration still fur
        ther, Flammarion has said:
        "The logical sequence is simple.
        If we were to see a triangle con
        structed on Mars we would be con
        siderably puzzled, but if we were
        to see it change first into a square
        and then into a circle we would
        think with some reason that such
        figures reveal without question the
        presence of a geometrician upon
        the neighbor world. The question
        however, now arises, what object
        our brethren could have in forming
        these figures. Why Bhould not the
        inhabitants of Mars be as curious
        as we are, more intelligent perhaps,
        more elevated in their aspirations,
        less hampered than we are in the
        mire of material needs? Why
        should they not suppose that the
        earth is inhabited as well a» their
        own world, and why should not the
        object of these geometrical appeals
        be to ask ub whethes whether we
        exist? It is not difficult to reply.
        They show us a triangle; we pro
        duce it here. They trace a circle;
        imitate it, and lo! communication
        is established.

        THE MARTIAN FORESTS
        VERIFIED BY OBSERVATIONS AT
        THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY.
        Remarkable Evidence of the Passase
        of tbe Seaoni, Foliase Changing
        from Green to Yellovr.
        Flagstaff (Ariz.) Letter in New York
        Herald.
        Since our communication to the Herald
        regarding the doubling of the Ganges, two
        other canals on Mars have begun to show
        double the Phison and the Euphrates. The
        importance of this observation lies in the
        fact that such duplication was precisely
        what theory led us to expect would occur.
        It is six weeks since the Ganges showed
        double at a time and in a manner parallel
        ing its appearances at the last apposition.
        The Phison and Euphrates are now in HXe
        manner counterpartlng their behavior of
        two years ago.
        Nor is this all. The surface of the planet,
        both in the light and the dark regions is
        undergoing the same metamorphosis It did
        then. In other words, the seasonal changes
        observed in the last Martian year are re
        peating themselves in this one. That these
        seasonal changes are the effect of vegeta
        tion upon the planet we showed then to be
        almost certainly the fact. The observations
        of this year help to confirm our deduction.
        The seasonal history of the two succes
        sive Martian years thus paralleling itself
        Is in detail most interesting to witness. Wre
        will begin with the behavior of the Syrtis
        Major and then pass on to that of the
        double canals. The Syrtis Major is the
        most important of the dark areas on the
        planet. It ia a curious funnel-shaped mark
        ing, large toward the south, and contract
        ing steadily northward till It comes to an
        end in two canals that curve respectively
        east and west away from it, forming the
        Astapus and the Nilosyrtis.
        It Is historically of great interest, because
        it was the first marking Identified with cer
        tainty on the planet by Huygens, in 1659,
        and by its identification first enabled the
        planet's rotation period to be found. It
        was then and long afterward believed to
        be a great sea or ocean, Its blue-green col
        or seeming to render this a most probable
        supposition. More minute examination has
        now, as we have said, rendered It practi
        cally certain that it Is, in fact, not an
        ocean at all, but the largest fertile region
        on the planet's surface, its blue-green hue
        being due to vegetation, leaves and trasses,
        or whatever relatives of such may consti
        tute the Martian flora.
        The following account of its successive
        appearances will show the reader the rea
        sons upon which this deduction of its char
        acter is based. Early in the Martian year
        the planet's southern hemisphere, the Syr
        tis Major, and the great contiguous dark
        area, under the same name, to the south,
        and now more commonly known as the
        Tyrrhenium, presents the appearance of one
        nearly uniform blue green surface. The
        only discernible diversities in it are the
        deeper tint of its northern end, the com
        paratively narrow neck of the funnel and
        of two long bands which join it to the polar
        sea, traversing about sixty degrees of lati
        tude in order to do so. These bands are of
        a deeper color than the rest of the region,
        but not so dark aa the bottom of the Syrtis
        itself.
        THE SEASONS ON MARS.
        Such is the appearance during the spring
        months, and such it continues to be into
        what corresponds In the Martian calendar
        to our May and June. After the summer
        solstice of the Martian southern hemi
        sphere, when the season passes from its
        June into its July, the extreme southern
        parts of the dark area fade and turn stead
        ily from a deep blue green to a fainter one
        and then into an orange ochre.
        Shortly after this there appears in the
        Syrtis Major itself strange mottllngs, Curi
        ous causewaylike appearances and rhom
        boidal areas of a perceptibly lighter tint
        than their surroundings. These then change
        further from a faint blue green to an
        orange ochre, just as happened before in
        the parts of the surface further south.
        These causeways, as we may designate
        them tor distinction, are very singular
        looking marks indeed. They stretch from
        the so-called continental bright areas of
        the planet over to the so-called islands to
        the south, and look precisely as if they
        were actual causeways connecting the two.
        There are a great many of them all around
        the planet. In the rejfion we are now re
        viewing there are two, both of them strik
        ing and peculiar Soils Pons and Lunae
        Pons, the former joining Hammonis Cornu,
        the great cape on the west side of the Sjrr
        tis, to the northern end of Hellas, 4he lat
        ter connecting In like manner the Circe
        Promontorium, the cape on the east side of
        the Syrtis, with Hellas. They both reach
        Hellas at almost, if not exactly, the same
        point.
        These two curious links between light re
        gions were first seen in 1894, about the tenth
        of the Martian July.
        To understand the significance of their
        apppearance this year we must note the
        time of the Martian year, owing to the dlf
        fr.rr.nt snepds with which the earth and
        Mars revolve about the sun. The earth
        otrtakes Mars once in about two years
        and two months. Such meetings are called
        oppositions, because the planet is then seen
        In the opposite part of the sky from the
        sim. Now, as the periods of the two plan
        ets are not exact multiples of each other.
        Mars has made, like the earth, about two
        of its months more than a revolution since
        the two planets met. In consequence we
        see him at a time about two months later
        in his year, with his reasons corresponding
        lv advanced.
        Thus, when observations began this year,
        it was not. in Martian time about the 1st
        of May, but about the 1st of July. Now
        as eoon as the planet was looked at there
        was the Lunae Pons distinctly visible. It
        appears singularly enough in the very first
        drawing made, on July 23. Our July, this
        Is, for it may be well to caution the reader
        to xeep the two calendars distinct. Close
        as ihe two dates of detection are for the
        two Martian years, it is quite possible that
        the phenomena required even nearer the
        same Martian date than this. For, in the
        first place, owing to the rotation of the
        planet the same side of his surface is not
        presented to the earth favorably for ob
        servation but for a part of each forty
        days, and it may therefore very well hap
        pen that an event taking place at the
        beginning of this observational gap may
        not be noticed as having happened till the
        end of it.
        MR. LOWELL'S OBSERVATION.
        In the next place different observers dif
        fer in what they must readily perceive, and
        it so chanced that the observer, Mr. Lowell,
        who first saw the Lunae Pons on both oc
        casions had not observed at just that Mar
        tian time. It is Interesting to note that
        these causeways are apparently optically
        connected with Mr. Douglass's canals In
        the dark regions, the one probably lying
        alongside the other. In addition to the
        causeways are the rhomboidal and other
        bright areas that seasonably arise in the
        Syrtis. Like the causeways, they have
        made their anpearance after the summer
        solstice of the southern hemisphere at both
        oppositions.
        Very curious features they are. One
        called Oenotria, looking like a long sand
        bar left high and dry on the receding of
        the tide, is on the western coast of the
        Syrtis and separated from Aeria by a deep
        blue green canal. It is, however, not an
        inundation or tide, but parching, that in all
        probability produces the metamorphosis we
        detect. The growth that in the heyday of
        its springtime looks so green, quickened
        by the water liberated from the south polar
        cap, has by the first of its July passed into
        the sere and yellow leaf.
        The speed with which It undergoes Its
        changes Is doubtless due to the greater
        aridity of Mars, the water not being suffi
        cient in amount to keep it longer alive.
        That all this was vegetal, not marine, is
        pretty conclusively shown, for the theory
        that the so-called seas should show differ
        ent tints implies that they were shallow
        enough to be seen through a highly im
        probable supposition on the face of it. That
        they changed from blue green to orange
        ochre over hundreds of square miles im
        plies, on the supposition that they areseas,
        an immense transference of water, which
        would occasion a corresponding darkening
        of other regions. No such corresponding
        darkening took place.
        Thirdly, that Mr. Douglass found them
        traversed by dark lines is quite Incompat
        ible with an aquatic character. Lastly, that
        Professor Pickering, with the pclariscope,
        found the only certain body of water on
        the planet, the polar sea, to show evi
        dence of being such, while the so-called
        seas showed none, is further conclusive as
        to their character.
        From the dark areas we pass to the light
        ones. Beside the Syrtis Major, to the west,
        lies. Aerla. It 13 here that are to be found
        the Phison and the Euphrates. During the
        Martian spring this great light area is to
        our present telescopic power one vast
        blank, a huge desert no more, no less.
        THE POLAR SEA.
        When the advancing warmth has un
        locked the polar snow and let the water
        find its way, aerially and otherwise, to the
        equator, strange lines begin to make their
        appearance athwart this desert. Two of the
        most conspicuous of them start from the
        middle of the southern side of ihe desert
        and run dlvergingly the one a little to the
        east, the other a little to the west of north
        down to the Nilosyrtis.
        The eastward one is the Phison; the west
        ward the Euphrates.
        In this singleness of look and Intent each
        continues until about the 1st of August,
        Martian time, when two lines begin to
        show where one showed before two lines
        exactly paralleling the originals in posi
        tion and direction. Indefinite at first, the
        twin lines gain distinctiveness as time goes
        on apparently solely by darkening, until
        at last the doubling Is unmistakable, and
        the two resemble nothing on earth so fiuch
        as the twin rails of a railroad track.
        All tlls happened two years ago at the
        proper reason of the Martian year, and it
        is all happening at the corresponding one
        now. At the present moment the lines are
        evidently double, but not very dark. The
        duplication is following the example of the
        Ganges in order of time, just as it did then.
        The details of the process are curious
        and suggestive. At the points where these
        lines, which are almost spiderlike in tenu
        ity, leave the dark regions there appear'
        what look like nicks In the contour of the
        edge of the desert. Wherever there are
        canals there are nicks, and where there
        are double canals there are double nicks.
        Now, these nicks are more conspicuous
        when well seen than the canals themselves,
        although when not well seen the canals
        are more easily detected, as long blurs,
        because of their length.
        Furthermore, they make their appear
        ance apparently rather before the canal
        Itself. Double nicks were seen where the
        double canals start in 1S94. The same
        double nicks at the confines of the deserts
        are visible now.
        What they are is one of the most inter
        esting problems before us. They are prob
        ably a sort of relay station for the water
        on Its way from the canals in the dark,
        region Into, those in the light.
        Of the oases it is not our purpose to how
        speak, although they, too, have made their
        appearance Just as they appeared two years
        ago. The significant point of the whole is
        that the seasonal phenomena of the Mar
        tian year are repeating themselves at this
        present one, even to details. Tl at Mars is
        not only a living world, but a very orderly
        one to boot, is pretty conclusively shown
        by the phenomena.

        Professor Morse, while not an astron
        omer by profession, has made a special
        study of Mars for many years. Hi
        new bo6k, '"'Mars and It Mystery,"
        which appeared early in October, con
        tains some astonishing revelations
        about our next-door neighbor in the
        solar system.
        Professor Morse thinks the inhabi
        tants of Mara may raise tobacco exten
        sively. The Martians may be even
        greater smokers than the men. of the
        earth. How Professor Morse got this
        idea is best explained in his own
        words.:
        "At certain times there has been ob
        served in the equatorial region of Mars
        a number of white spots, which have
        greatly puzzled the student of Mars,
        and for which no explanation has yet
        been- offered. That they are not clouds
        is seen in the fact that they do not
        move or drift. Furthermore, these
        white spots are fixed features of the
        region, as they appear in the same
        places.. ._,.:._
        '.'It might "Ke* suggested "that they
        represent snow-capped elevations or
        mountain peaks, but this is difficult to
        believe, as an examination of the ter
        minator of Mars reveals no evidences
        of -high elevations. These white spots
        appear only in midsummer, which
        would argue against their being snow
        caps, as in midsummer they would cer
        tainly melt and disappear. The time
        of their appearance coincides with the
        time of greatest equatorial heat.
        "Since the appearance of these
        white spots in Mars corresponds with
        the period of greatest evaporation, it
        is conceivable that an intelligence in
        Mars might utilize the same method
        which has recently been adopted in
        Connecticut and Porto Rico in the
        raising of tobacco, namejy, to protect
        the fields with white cotton cloth."
        It is the canals of Mars, however,
        that furnish Professor Morse with the
        strongest evidence of life on the red
        planet. On this point he quotes Pro
        fessor Pcrcival Lowell of Boston, who
        has made more extensive obrervations
        of the Martian canals than any other
        astronomer. He says:
        "What we see hints of the existence
        of beings who are in advance of, not
        behind, us in the -journey of life."
        Problems of a Dying World.
        A peculiar interest is excited in these
        superior beings because they have
        grappled with the problems of a dying
        world. They have learned how to ex-,
        ist on a desert planet where water is
        the scarcest and most precious thing in
        existence. Their whole world is much
        like the Sahara desert, or the flat des
        ert plain of our own Arizona.
        Yet on a dried-up world of this -sort
        they evidently have built up and con
        tinue to maintain a civilization far in
        advance of anything on the earth. This
        is indicated by the complex canal sys
        tem that prevails all over their globe.
        One of their canals alone is over 3,000
        miles in length, long enough to reach
        from Boston to San Francisco. In
        deed, canals on Mars seem to be
        aswiths
        numerous as railroads on the earth.
        Professor Morse has made a drawing
        showing how similar some parts of our
        network of railroads are to the Martian
        canal lines. The canals of Holland also
        present a similarity. These illustra
        tions are set forth to show that such
        markings must be the works of intelli
        gent beings rather than the haphazard
        cracks or markings of nature. Profes
        sor Morse sums up the argument in fa
        vor of the Martian canals being arti
        ficial in these words:
        "The unnatural straightness of these
        interlacing lines on Mars, many of
        them following the arcs of great cir
        cles their unilorm width thruout, their
        always starting from definite areas, their
        convergence to common centers, find
        no parallel in natural phenomena.''
        Where these canals meet one another
        are circular areas, indicating great
        oases, and probably large cities.
        Professor Morse gained much of the
        material for this book by a visit to
        the southwest. He spent five weeks at
        Professor Lowell's observatory at Flag
        staff, Ariz. In the dry, steady, clear
        air, 7,000 feet above sea level, ho
        studied the surface of Mars thru a
        telescope. He saw the pale yellow disk
        of the planet gradually develop a net
        work of dark markings. I was like
        a photographic plate, first blank and
        then mysteriously taking on shades and
        lines.till a world picture was presented.
        Looking about him in that desert re
        gion, Professor Morse found an explan
        ation of the Martian mystery.
        Explanation of the Martian Mystery.
        "Let one stand on some peak of the
        Verde mountains," he said, "northeast
        from Phoenix, Ariz., overlooking the
        Gila river as it follows its course across
        the desert, and after the river is lost
        to view he will notice that the foliage
        /long its banks marks its course.

        "If one $ake$ this view in" winter
        time, the ui=iform gray of the plains,
        Unbroken by^fe-shade of color, blends
        with the lightsbitt^.of the distant Plo
        mas and Ca&tle.Dome mountains on the
        southwest horizon. In the early spring,
        when the water is first let into the
        irrigating channels, with their innumer
        able divergent ditches, a, shade of green
        may be seen emerging from the monot
        onous yellow-gray of the hot and ster
        ile plain, first conspicuous near the
        source of the water supply, and then
        following along to Phoenix, Temple and
        other regions, till in full efflorescence
        these cities stand out like great green
        carpets spread upon the earth.
        From this mountaintop not a trace
        of an irrigating ditch, large or small,
        would be discerned, except here and
        there a glint, of reflected sunlight, but
        the effects of the life-giving waters can
        be traced in broad bands to the re-?
        motest limits of the water channels,
        when they would end as abruptly as
        they had begun."
        Professor Morse makes this explana
        tion to illustrate how wide areas of
        vegetation may be seen at a great dis
        tance, so great, indeed, that canals
        themselves would be invisible. The
        canals of Mars are believed to be gi
        gantic irrigating ditches, very similar
        to those now in operation in the'west
        and those being constructed by.tbe-govr
        eminent.
        As life on Mars appears to be sus
        tained solely by irrigation, it would
        seem that its inhabitants. are great ag
        riculturists. We are only beginnings to
        learn how to produce vegetation and
        sustain life on deserts. But the. Mar
        tian have covered their whole globe
        irrigation works. Professor
        Morse thinks they must understand the
        principles-of hydraulics far better than
        our best civil engineers.,
        Their sole source of water supply
        seems to be the snow caps that- form
        at the poles during the winter. When
        these snowcaps begin to melt, the wa
        ter is conducted by the canals clear
        down to the equator, and probablv
        every drop of it conserved and used
        over and over again for irrigating the
        land.
        Inhabitants of the Planet. .,V'
        What manner of beings these are
        that have created such a prodigious,
        universal waterworks system is a mys
        tery. Professor Morse appears to
        think they may be like men or gigan
        tic ants. For men and ants, he ob
        serves, exist at the greatest extremes
        of elevation, where the air is heaviest
        and rarest, as well as in places where
        the climate is hottest and coldest.
        On Mars the air is exceedingly/rare,
        about half the density of the atmos
        phere on the highest mountain tops of
        the earth. A man from the earth sud
        denly transported there, Professor
        Morse thinks, would give a few gasps
        and die. But the rarefaction of the
        air has taken place by very slow de
        grees, and for this reason Professor
        Morse conjectures that man might sur
        vive the change. He says on this point:
        "One has only to make himself fa
        miliar with the wide range of. cond^
        tions under which life in various forms
        exists on the earth to realize that the
        introduction of Martian" conditions here
        would not be such an overwhelming
        calamity. If these conditions could be
        introduced by minute increments cover
        ing thousands of centuries, it' is not
        unreasonable to believe that myriads
        of forms would survive the change
        and among those that survive would be
        precisely th$ kinds that thrive under
        the most diverse conditions here, name-
        4. CANALS, OKONIMOXN. HOUAKQ
        ly, man and the higher hymenoptera,
        the ants."
        We have the choice, then, of consid
        ering the Martian either a man or gi
        gantic being,, adapted to breathing the
        rarefied air, or a mammoth ant. Pro
        fessor Morse seems to lean to the idea
        that a creature very like man is theof
        Martian intelligent being.
        What Martians Might Say of Us.
        One of the most interesting parts
        of Professor Morse's book is the chap
        ter on "What the Martians Might Say
        of Us," which begins:
        "For every single perplexity of inter
        pretation we encounter in our study of
        the surface markings of Mars the Mar
        tian would encounter a dozen perplexi
        ties in interpreting the various features
        on the surface of the earth.

        When the nature of the business of the Tailors' Misfit Ex-
        change was explained to the public last week we prophesied the
        bargains w should offer in high-grade, made-toorder Suits and
        Overcoats would keep us good and busy.
        As you are aware, we had our opening Saturday, and, with-
        out exaggeration, the store was literally packedJail day with cus-
        tomers and would-be customers. 7
        We very much regret that our limited space compelled us to
        turn away a lot of men who wanted to get next to the good
        things, but have made arrangements to overcome this difficulty
        on Monday.
        We shall have a much larger force of salesmen tomorrow, and
        the bargains we shall offer will be greater than ever.
        Among the good
        thingsa offeredvests,:made
        this world In examining the earth as
        we have examined Mars, the Martian
        would find large yellow and reddish
        areas, extensive greenish areas, and,
        besides, large regions of varying shades
        of blue, occupying throe-fourths of the
        earth's surf/ace. The vellow areas he
        would interpret as desert land, the
        greenish areas he might consider vege
        tation, but "what would he make out
        of the larger regions of blue? ThiB
        would certainly puzzle him, because, un
        familiar with oceahB, he could not be
        lieve that suckvast tracts could really
        be water: He, 'would easily interpret
        the polar caps .and the water at their
        edges, but the oceans would be impossi
        ble to solve."
        "Even i.he"rocognizod oases in the
        deserts of America and Africa, the re
        sults of artesian wells or springs, he
        could not believe them to be vegeta
        tion, for he WQ^'ld detect no irrigating
        canals running into them. He would
        come to the conclusion that no creature
        could possibly exist on the earth. Tho
        tremendous force of gravitation and
        atmospheric pressure would forbid the
        existence of organic forms. Life, if it
        existed, must have legs of iron to sus
        tain its weight, and a crust like a turtle
        to be impervious to the force of rain
        drops, and this.wouldbe contrary to all
        Martian analogy..
        "Believing that Mars is rightly bal
        anced as to temperature, the. earth, be
        ing so mach-nearer the sun, would be
        too hot for lire to exist. The Martian
        considers our year too short. In his
        reflections he says: 'During the pe
        riod in which one of us attains the
        middle age of 50 years, thoSe on earth
        have become decrepit old men of 94.
        if indeed.they,,are. not already dead.'
        "If there is an intelligence on Mars,"
        writes Professor Morse, "it must have
        evolved alongf the same general lines as
        intelligence has developed on the earth.
        Being an older planet, it must have out
        grown many of the vagaries and illu
        sions which still hamper man in Ms
        progress here.",

        WILL THE NEW YEAR SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF MARS?
        ANOTHER and tmal message from
        Mars trill soon be in general
        hand. If not epoch making as
        a milestone of astronomy, it is
        the moFt absorbing and extraor
        dinary word on an ever fascinating
        subject that has bee-n spoken since
        Sehiaparelll first discussed the inhabit
        ubillty of Mar* aloud. For Professor
        Pcrclval Lowell, our greatest M.'.rtlan
        student, now declare* positively and
        without reservation that our nearest
        planetary neighbor is not only alive
        with vegetation made possible by
        means of vast artificial canals, but is
        peopled by an order of beings In many
        respects quite superior to ourselves!
        In other words, Professor Lowell has
        solved, at U-ast to his own satisfaction,
        the greatest riddle of the ages — the ex
        isfnep of life in another world!
        Since 1877, when Sehiaparelll aston
        ished laymen and astronomers by an
        nouncing the discovery of the Martian
        «.anals, etar gazers have kept their eyes
        focused upon th« face of the red maned
        planet. Acres of white, paper have been
        covered with notes of whst they saw.
        And. finally, Profrssor Lowell and his
        aids at the Flagstaff observatory suc
        ceeded in actually photographing the
        Martian canals. His new volunio, 1s-
        Mi.-,i by the Macmillan Company, Ik the
        first formal announcement of his recent
        «i!(srrvatlonß «.nd conclusions that has
        horn published. Not only in hln verdict
        liipliiy revolutionary from a scientific
        viewpoint, but It is no lc«e daring tlian
        convincing when v|pw*d Impartially.
        Stupendous ax the conclusion is from
        t'to facts presented *b calmly and dis
        pOßsionately by Professor Lowell, we
        arc nou 1 actually Introduced to b'-ings
        oaj Mtr« resembling ourselves In many
        «'?»entla.l features.
        owlnr. for instance, to the vast d*s
        it areas there — to the uttf r absence of
        water on most of the surface — It Is
        reasonable to suppose that the Martian
        means of transportation are other than
        our own. For the people must com
        municate with one another, since. Pro
        feasor Lowell is convinced, water from
        the poles Is distributed among the pop
        ulous oases hundreds and thousands of
        miles apart. And the only possible
        agency, in view of the physical flatness
        of the planet and of the fact that the
        force of gravity at any distance from
        the eonter of Mars is only one-tenth
        the gravity toward the center of the
        «>«rth at the same distance, is artificial.
        If. In other words, our force of gravity
        its represented by 100. It !« only 27 on
        Mars, co-nslflerlny that Mars is only .63
        the size of the onrth. There our pound
        would weigh only about six ounces, and
        it Martian of human «ixe murt be more
        than twtre as strong as the. average
        man here. ' •
        Without indulging In mental aero
        nautics on*> reaches the logical conclu
        sion that aerial navigation 1* the easl
        rrt and most reasonable means of
        transportation for our etarry neigh
        bors. Indeed, it if not improbable that
        they are equipped, granting their ex
        istence, with such knowledge of nat
        ure! forces, or euoh physical attributes,
        as may enable them to propel tliem
        erjves from place to place as would our
        own mechanical birds. Following are
        tho salient feature* in this amazing
        message from Mare:
        Professor Lowell
        «-|— HAT Mars is Inhabited by beings
        I of one sort or another w? may con
        sider as certain. The theory of an
        existent Intelligent life there may be
        likened to the atomic theory in chem
        istry: tho behavior of chemle com
        pounds points to the existence of atoms
        too 'email for u» to see. and in the same
        way the aspect and behavior of the
        Martian markings Imply the action of
        agents too far away, as yet, to be dis
        cerned.
        Though In neither case ran we tell
        anything of the bodily manifestation,
        we can, In both, affirm a good deal about
        their workings. Girdling Mars, for ex
        ample, and stretching from pole to
        pole, the Martian canal system not
        only embraces their whole world,* but
        is an organized entity. Each canal
        Joins another, which in turn connects
        with a third, and co on over the entire
        surface of the planet This continuity
        of construction proves a community
        of Interest; and when we consider that,
        though not «o large ac the earth, the
        world, of Mars Is 4200 miles in diam
        eter. and contains something like 212,
        000,000 square miles, the unity of the
        process acquires considerable signifi
        cance. The eupposod vast enterprises
        of the earth are. dwarfed by .compari
        son, being merely as a civic subway
        compared with one of continental pro
        portions.
        The first thing that is forced on us In
        carefully studying conditions on the
        planet Is the necessarllyMntelllgent and
        peaceful character of the community
        which could thus act as a unit through
        out its globe. War is a survival
        among us from savage times, and af
        fects chiefly the boyish and unthinking
        element of the cation. The wls«st
        realize that there are better ways" for
        practicing heroiFiri and other and more
        certain means of insuring the survival
        of the fittest. War is something a
        people outgrow. But, whether they
        consciously practice peace or not, na
        ture In Ite evolution practices it for
        them, . "
        Whether Increasing common, sense cr
        Increasing necessity was the spur; that
        drove the Martians tp this 'eminently
        sagacious state, it Is certain; that they
        have reached It and. actually certain
        that they, would " otherwise perlsliTrin
        the absence of the great Martian canal
        system-T-provingr-not only the" world
        wide sagacity of the builders.; but a
        very suggestive sidelight .. to c the .fact:
        that only a universal necessity such as
        water coulC well be ./ts underlying
        cause,. .
        That* the habltat'of both *, plants - and \u25a0
        animals is conditioned not by the'mini
        mum nor' by the mean, temperature • of ,
        locality, but by the maximum heat at
        tained in the region, is now appreciated
        by, science, .the reason being: that the
        continuance of the epecles seems. to de r

        They are unquestionably desert areas.

        In other \u25a0words, , the gradual en
        croachment of desert areas on earth
        finds a parallel in Mars, excepting that,
        pitiless as our deserts ar?, they arc but
        faint forecasts of the state of things
        on Mars today. *
        From the detection of the main
        markings on the planet surface we now
        pass to a discovery so unprecedented
        that the scientific world was at first
        loth to accept it— that of the canals.
        Not everybody can- see these delicate
        lines at first sight, even when pointed
        ont to them. When viewed under* the
        best conditions, however, the disk of
        the planet takes on a most singular
        appearance. It looks as if it had been
        cobwebbed all over — a. mesh of nno
        lines which., with ( attention, proves to
        compass tho globe from one pole to the
        other. ~~
        It Is due wholly to the lack of suit
        able conditions-that the true form; of
        the Martian lines is usually missed.
        Given the proper prerequisites of loca
        tion or of,eye, and their pencil mark
        peculiarly stands forth unmistakably
        confessed. The sole method of esti
        mating their width is by comparison
        of effect with a wire of known size at a
        Known distance. For this purpose a
        telegraph wire was stretched against
        the sky at Flagstaff, and the observers,
        going back upon the mesa, observed
        and recorded its appearance as their,
        stations: grew remote, it proved sur- v
        prising at what great distances a alewwf
        derwire could be made out wheff thua
        projected against the sky. The wire in
        the experiment was but .0728 of an
        inch in diameter and yet could be seen
        with certainty at a distance of igoo
        feet, at which point Its diameter sub
        tended only .69 of a second of are. How
        small this is may be appreciated from
        its taking more than ninety such lines
        laid side by side to make a width divis
        ible iby the eye. Theoretically, then a
        line three-fourths of. a mile wide on
        Mars-would be visible to us through
        our powerful:telescopes.-
        But we will take a mile or two safety
        as the smallest width for one of the
        lines.. The greatest waa got by com

        . , ilany interesting theories about
        i hi tte life of Mars have been put
        iafc forward, but all of them have been
        jb open to some objection. Professor
        Laa : Percival Lowell, of the Flagstaff
        ' Obaervatory in Arizona, has argued
        1(y9 that the so-called canals of Mars sire
        sflr1 . vast engineering works, and con
        5," ' cequently that the inhabitants who
        ffyti bailt thera were of great intellectual
        lajfeij development. The scientific novel-
        m'?M H G- Wel,B' bas builL an ox-
        $f-2m tremely interesting story ou the
        basis Hint the Martians are octopus
        like creatures, without bony struc
        ture, but possessed of highly devel
        oped brains. A common assumption of
        many speculators has been that
        the Martians are extremely at
        tenuated creatures, because the
        slight pressure of gravity on the
        surface of the planet would favor
        this form.
        Now a new and exceedingly inter
        esting theory concerning the life
        on Mars has been put forward by
        Professor William Wallace Camp
        bell, of the great Lick Observatory,
        California. He suggests that all
        life ou Mars has taken a vegetable,
        form.
        ThlK. -ttfGory Is one of the most
        plausible that bns been put
        forward. It has the support of all
        the facts about Mars that have been
        scientifically established and it
        avoms many of the improbabilities
        involved In other theories on the
        same 3ubjecL t
        The vegetation theory rests pri
        marily on the fact proved by spec
        troscopic analysis that there is an
        enormous proportion of carbonic
        acid gas In the atmosphere of Mars
        which would make animal ijfG n'f.
        the kind known to the earth er
        coedingly dllfleull, if not impossible,
        while it would greatly favor the
        development of vegetation.
        Before considering this theory
        .further, we must bear in mind a
        few of the proved facts about Mars.
        It has atmosphere, seasons, land,
        wator. storms, clouds and moun
        tains. It also rains and snows on
        Mars, as it does with us. Great
        white patches appear periodically
        upon Its surface. These may be
        accumulations of snow and they
        have also been called "eyes." Their
        nature will be discussed later.
        When Mars approaches nearest to
        the earth it is. seen to. have a. bright
        rod color and sometimes looks like
        a red lamp in the sky. It has been
        suggested that the vegetation for
        tho most part Is yellow or orange
        instead of green, as with us, thus
        giving the planet its color.
        Mars has two moons, the near
        est of which Is but 3,700 miles away
        and revolves around the planet in
        seven hours and a half, showing
        all the phases of our moon in one
        night.

        nnd torrid zones,
        which would still
        blossom if water-
        ed. Here .we may
        note one of the
        strongest arguments tn favor of the
        vegetation theory of life.
        Professor Lowell has argued that
        the canals of Mars, first discovered
        by Professor Scbiaparelli, of Milan,
        but long considered optical Illusions
        by mauv astronomers, are the ir
        rigation " works of the inhabitants.
        The canals are singularly artificial
        in appearance. They extend toward
        the equator from the poles and
        cover tho planet like a fine. netting.,
        Each caual -is tho- shortest dls-.
        lance, between two points and in
        variably runs to a pclnt called "an
        oasis." where it meets other cauals
        not lu haphazard fashion, but ac
        cording -to some plan.
        The "canals" vary in longth from
        2r0 miles to over 3,000
        miles, a length that is astonishing
        when it is considered that thv
        diameter of Mars is only 4,220
        miles. All told, Professor Lowell
        has plotted -137 of tbeso canals and
        1S6 oases. It was Professor Pick
        ering, a close associate of Profcsso.
        Lowell, who first saw these oases
        Thc canals of Mars appear am!
        disappear with the seasons. In
        other words they slowly creep dowu
        from the poles encb Spriug and
        slowly retreat with tho approach of
        Winter. If thc canals are artlficla.
        In origin, this phenomenon would
        appear to mean that the Martians
        are busily engaged in digging stu
        pendous canals, only to fill them up
        again every year.
        Professor Pickering Ingeniously
        avoided this embarrassing conclu
        sion by pointing out that we see
        not the canals themselves, but tho
        vegetation which friuges their
        banks and thus indicates their
        com sc. Vegetation must grow be
        fore I lie canol3 aro lsiblo and must
        disappear before the cauals vanish.
        Here we can see why the theory
        that all the life ou Mars is vege
        tation is more probable than any
        other. Professor Pickering admits
        that tho sigus of life we see arc
        vegetable, but suggests that then
        are the work of man-like creature"
        whom we cannot see. But we knu .

        The original genu
        of life on earth was
        neither animal nor
        vegetable. Many
        stages of develop
        - incut passed before
        the two forms of life
        : became separated.

        reasonable to believe that they
        would have developed an intelli
        gence at least equal to that of mnn
        if conditions h3d been favorable.
        Such conditions have prevailed on
        Mars. Chief among th m Is an at
        mosphere very favorable, to plant
        Ufo and very unfavorable to animal
        life. .
        There are on the earth many
        carnivorous plants which though
        unmistakably vegetable in form pos
        sess many of the powera of animals.
        These plants Include the butcher
        plant, pitchor plant, the sundew,
        the butter wort and, many other
        forms. They range from plants
        that eat Insects to those that are
        capable of devouring birds and
        small mammals.
        The pitcher plant, for Instance, has
        a heavy flesh leaf ten inches long.
        With the spiked point of the leal
        it strikes a rat, numbing it with
        the poison it contains. Then the
        lear folds over the animal and it Is
        absorbed into 'the body of the plant
        and digested.

        and hide their life in the soil tUl

        duces the appearance of "canals' H
        to us. The reason these canals have H
        euch a regular form is that the H

        advanced theory, all life ou Mars
        took the vegetable form. Animal
        races then existing were con
        sciously or unconsciously absorbed
        into tho vegetable races.
        The vegetable life, possessed ot
        true Intelligence, then evolved Into
        one organic whole in order to ob
        tain the greatest advantage from
        the liraitod means of sustenance.
        Life on Mars Is now ono vast in
        tellect supported by a vegetable
        bodv having its roots In the soil.
        Such a conception of lire -isembles
        the vast being into vhich the Budd
        hists eay all men will be absorbed.

        By H. Qernsback,
        Editor of Electrical Experimenter and
        Radio Amateur News.
        IN oar ptenaUry system there are prob
        ably only three planets now capable
        at beating organised life. They are
        (fee aarth. Venus and Mars. It haa been
        Ann conclusively that the major plan
        eta, each a* Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
        Meptuna, are all still in a plastic or molten
        rtata. And Ufa aa we know It cannot exist
        am a pis?t ahuaa surface has not as yet
        pooled to a firm crust, and whose tempera
        tare la Car above the boiling point ot
        Tfcoae large planets are still in their
        early chtMbood, vhile the earth may bo
        termed in its "teens." it being a tew steps.
        afcaad of the evolution of the major plan
        ets. Venus 1s probably abreast of tbo
        earth's progress, or perhaps Just a stop bo>
        hta?f*us.
        We know verj little about Venus because
        ao human being has ever seen its surface.
        It Is constantly enshrouded In vast masses
        <4 -loads making it impossible to see the
        lasd or^oceans. Being twenty-Are million
        miles nearer to the sun than our earth, It
        receives twice as much heat. This gives
        rise to a much greater amount of evapo
        ration?hence the constant clouding.
        We may be sure, however, that organ
        ised life exists on Venus. Where there
        are water and clonds. which must givp
        Van as a similar atmosphere to our owl
        organized life must exist without a shade
        of a dohbt.
        -But now what of Mars, that interesting
        planet with which scientists dream of
        some day communicating?
        Being much smaller. Mars cooled down
        hundreds of thousands of years before
        the earth did. If the earth is in its
        teens Mars is well along In the eighties.
        organized Ufa there must have begun
        eons before it did here.
        To form say fdequate conception of what
        Ufa on Mars is like we must first under
        stand the conditions under which It exists?
        esadltions radically different from those
        aider which wo on this earth live.
        Our teiescopee reveal a very great scar
        city of atmosphere on Mars. We know this
        Dsn the exceedingly rare cloud forma
        tfsna. The air is so thin theft that a man
        saddeeiy transoort^d from the earth to
        Mars would suffocate in a few minutes.
        Aad Mars la losing its atmosphere Into
        space much quicker than the earth be
        cause of Its lower gravitation.
        One terrestrial pound walffhs only about a
        third of a pound ou Mars. Therefore Mais
        does not hold down its air aa strongly as
        la the case oa earth, and the air eacar>es
        more quickly Into the outer space. While
        this process is slow, requiring millions >f
        years. It la steady and inexorable.
        The accompanying diagrams, reproduced
        from a recent issue of the Electrical Ex
        perimenter. show the wide differences in
        the amount of gravitational pull found be
        neath the earth's surface and on Mars and
        Eros
        If you were to descend a shaft drilled
        right throngh the centre of the earth you
        would steadily lose weight until you
        reached the earth's centre, where you.
        would weigh nothing at alL
        An average American living oa Mars
        would be able to lift and carry about with
        ease a safe weighing 554 pounds, and on '
        Bros be would actually be able to lift a big
        mogul locomotive weighing K2.M0 pounds.
        But to return to the condltlous life haa
        to face on Mars. Scant air, as every avia
        tor knows, lowers the temperature. How
        raach colder is It then oa Mars with an
        atmoephere thinner than an aviator ever
        breathed oa earth? Also It most be rw
        membered that
        Mars Is forty-eight
        million miles fur
        ther away from
        the tun than the
        earth, and that on
        this account alone
        it receives bnt half
        the heat we do.
        Bearing these
        facts in mind,
        what sort of life
        does Mars sup
        port? How ha3
        nature accustomed
        the Martian to his
        changing en Tirol*
        ment down through
        the tens of thott>
        of centuries
        of Ma htotory? I?
        he a biped or a
        quadruped? Is be
        a mammal or ft
        highly cultured fish
        or a sort of think
        ing bird? We dont
        know. We can only
        speculate.
        Nature always
        does the surprising
        and biaarre thing
        ? If yon dont
        think to look at a
        devil fish or a
        giraffe or a chame
        leon or a bat. Any
        one of them could
        hare been equipped
        with a human
        brain nad nature
        thought it expedi
        ent. But for some
        reason they were
        not. On the other
        hand, ants and bees
        probably "think'"?
        Due to the very rare Martian. atmosphere the
        Martian's chest moat be enormous to accommodate
        his ponderout lungs, necessary to supply his
        oxygen. Rare atmosphere conducts sound very
        poorly, hence the large ears, necessary'to catch the
        very weak sounds. Due to the poor atmosphere it
        ia exceedingly cold on Mara, except at (he equator.
        Hence Martians are covered with a white polar fur
        from head to foot A rare atmospheris conducts
        odors but poorly, hence die elephantine nose, which
        goes to die odor, as the odor can't come to the
        Martian.
        Gravity on Mars being much less than on earth
        ?i lb. on earth weighs 0.3s lbs. on Mars?the pu}l
        on his body ia very small. Therefore his height is
        from 10 to is feet. To support such a tall body
        where gravity ia small, better footing ia necessary.
        hence the big feet. The tremendously civilized
        Martian always rides or flies from place to place;
        his lags are tiros almost .melees, hence devoid of
        muscles, consequently thin.
        The Martian stopped all physical work millions
        of years ago; machines do his work. His arms thaa
        are weak and thin. But the hands and eyes?the
        Martian's moat important organs, are used and
        worked constantly?hence are developed wonder
        folly. As his food is all taken in highly concen
        trated form and as he does not talk, the Martian's
        mouth has shrank very smalt
        Talking in a rare atmosphere being almost ia>
        possible, die Martian communicates by his telep*?
        thic organ, a sort of sensitive skin stretched be
        tween antler-like prominences on top of his head.
        The same organ sends out the telepathic waves.
        perhaps better than we do. Contrawise. If
        the? do, they probably think that all of
        out acta are due to "Instinct." In their way
        they are probably right It depends only
        upon the point of view.
        But given like conditions evolution will
        progress alike In widely separated spheres.
        The Indians on the American Continent
        developed about the same as the Euro
        peans, although they had not intermingled
        for thousands of years. It is not even ab
        solutely certain that they have not sprung
        into being on their own accord.
        Following this line of reasoning?and the
        writer admits it may be all wrong?there
        Is a strong chance that the Martian has de
        veloped In s manner similar to that of man
        on earth. As a matter of fact, the chances
        are greaJy In Its favor. If w? grant this
        truth. It should be easy to form a mental
        picture of the Martian under his present
        unfavorable conditions upon his planet.
        To begin with, the Martian race, millions
        of years older tuan the terrwitrlal, must
        have advanced tremendously. The Mar
        tian's head, due to his greatly developed
        brain, must be enormous. On account of
        the low gravitational force on Mars, where
        his body is pulled downward with only one
        third of the weight as that on earth, the
        Martian must be of great height. He is at
        least ten or twelve feet tall. Geotropism
        on earth proves this amply.
        To support such a tall body where grav
        ity is so small, better footing Is necessary,
        hence the big (eet are required. The tre
        mendously civilized Martian always rides
        or flies from [la to place; his legs are
        thus Mnjpst unless. Just l'u* a sto'V's, for
        instance?d oid of musdies. thin and
        sinewy.
        Due to the very rare Martian atmos
        phere, the Martian's cheat must be enor
        Pious to accommodate the ponderous
        lungs which are necessary to supply air
        and oxygen to his large body. On the
        other hand, rare atmosphere conducts
        sound very poorly, hence large ears are
        required to catch the exceedingly weak
        sounds.
        As already mentioned, due to the poor
        atmospl^ere, it is exceedingly cold on Mars,
        except at the equator. Even here it is
        freezing. Hence Martians are probably
        oovered from head to foot with a white
        polar fur. A rare atmosphere conducts
        odors but rocly. We thus nay expect the
        man on Mars to have an elephantine nose,
        which goes to the odor, as the odor can't
        com* to the Martian.
        The Martian must certainly have
        stopped all bodily work millions of years
        ago; machines have done his work for
        ages. His arms thus are weak and thin.
        But the hands and eyes?the Martian's
        most Important organs?are used and
        worked constantly and therefore are de
        veloped to an undreamed of degree.
        He probably has six or more fingers on
        his hands Even on earth we have already
        ?ix-flngered human beings.
        His eyes probably can be extended from
        their sockets at the end of a sort of ten
        tacle, the same as a snail's. This gives the
        Martian a larger range of vision, without
        the trouble of moving his head about As
        his food is all taken In highly concentrated
        form and as he cannot talk, the Martian's
        mouth has shrunk to very small dimen
        sions. Talking in a rarificd atmosphere
        being almost impossible?for there are no
        sound waves in a vacuum?tbe Martian
        communicates by means of his telepathic
        (O) MIS, International Feature Barrier. Inc.
        organ, a sort of sensitive skin stretched
        between antler-like prominences on top of
        bis huge head. This organ sends out the
        telepathic waves/ The antlers protect the
        sensitive skin asrainst blows, etc.
        This statement need not be ridiculed.
        Certain animals, each as our ants, havo a
        highly developed telepathic orean. Stu
        dents of ants know that the killing of one
        ant will be Immediately sensed by others,
        although ten or more feet distant. And
        within a few seconds they will hare ar
        rived at the spot where the death occurred.
        The possibility that Mars is inhabited
        by strange creatures like that pictured on
        this page it itrengthened by the fact that
        in other parts of the universe life persists
        under the moat extreme conditions imag
        inable. Certain species of fish may be
        frozen stone hard for days, and will revive
        after thawing out.
        Thirty years ago it was strenuously de
        nied that there could be living creatures
        at the bottom of the ocean, where such
        tremendoul pressure exists, as well as in
        tense cold. It was argued that no living
        thing oould withstand suoh enormous pres
        sure as 12.000 pounds tf? the square inch,
        or exist in the inky darkness of the ocaan
        depths. But our deep sea expedltiona
        brought up flah from these tremendous
        depths as signal proof that nature some
        how manages to implant life in the most
        impossible placea, under the most unfavor
        able conditions.
        Life-bearing apores have been frozen in
        a vacuum almost down to the absolute
        zero They have been subjected to tre
        mendous hydraulic pressures. Still life

        the lowest and most humble beginning
        The history of evolution throughout na
        ture shows Invariably that antmai life Is
        the direct product of Its environment. h>
        order to survive, nature equips each animal
        with the necessary organs best edited for
        its particular environment. Thus the ca
        terpillar is colored green to match the
        color of the leaves on which he feasts
        If be were red In color the birds would
        prey upon him sooner. The camel can go
        for weeks without water, there being nonn
        or little tn the desert. Nature eqntpped tho
        camel with certain organs so that be needs
        less water than other animals of hie site.
        The elephant, due to his big site, round it
        difficult to drink water, which he likes and
        needs. It m imprac

        water, so that the ele
        phant does not have
        to bend down on his
        knees.
        This all goes to
        prore thst nature, in
        Its effort to accus
        tom life to its envtr

        are like a re-fectly
        le?"it!nnte gub'ect for
        scientific speculation.
        Such a be*n(r as has
        been described here is
        the sort of one Natura
        would find *t neceesary to dezelop in order
        to meet the peculiar conditions existing
        on Mars.
        Some Interesting comparison* given in
        a recent issue of the Eectrical Experi
        menter he'p to make clear the wide differ
        ence between the conditions prevail ng on
        Mars and the e*rth and show how certain
        it is that the Martian must be a very dif
        ferent sort of creature from mm.
        If a man who weighs 150 pounds here
        could be suddenly transported to Mars be
        v ould find on reaching there that he
        tipped the scales at only S3 pounds. The
        shrinkage would be .due ent rely to the
        lesser gravitational pull on Mjrs.
        But in return for this reduction In his
        avoirdupois the visitor to Mars would bsve
        certain compensations. He would be able
        to leap a distance of eleven feet into the
        air without the slightest difficulty, as com
        pared with a mere four feet here He
        would be able to pick up and carry off ?
        weight of 564 pounds as easily as he could
        200 pounds here on the earth.
        A cannon flred from this earth would
        have to attain a velocity of five miles a
        second in order to shoot a project.le into
        the air so that it would never return. But
        a projectile fired from Mnrs at the rate of
        only a small fraction more than a mile a
        second would never return to the planet
        but would become a new satellite.
        What scientists term the low velocity
        of escape is believed to have an impor
        tant bearing upon the possibility of the
        planet's possessing and holding stmoe
        ph??re. Even if Mars were originally
        clothed with ao extensive atmosphere it
        is believed, according to the pinetlc theory
        of gases, that It is losing It molecule by
        molecule.

        By Arnold D. Prince
        IF IT should prove to be the case
        after all that those mysterious
        Marconi "messages" came from
        Mars or even Venus, the next
        problem of importance will be the
        "dud of people who sent them. For,
        of course, if the earth is to have new
        neighbors with whom to exchange
        gossip across the back yard of the
        sidereal firmament, it will want to
        know something about them. It will
        want to know something of their
        habits, appearance, how they dress,
        act and possibly their views on in?
        terplanetary relations. All sorts of
        situations may arise wherein a
        mutual understanding of personal
        traits, characteristics and general
        disposition will aid in establishing
        and preserving amicable relations.
        Signor Marconi, unfortunately,
        was not able to throw much light on
        the subject. Virtually all that came
        within the scope of his observation
        was that when prosecuting wireless '
        experiments certain "signals oc?
        curred'' with persistent regularity
        which could not be explained on the
        theory of casual interference. As '
        these signals had been received
        "simultanecuslv_ at New York and
        London with identical intensity," he
        admitted the possibility of their be?
        ing attempts by the inhabitants of
        fother planets to communicate"
        with us.

        What kind of people, then, in
        i ?bit these two planots? In seek?
        ing an answer to this question the
        inquirer is thrown back almost ex?
        clusively, of course, on the con?
        clusions of the scientists who have
        made a 6tudy of the subject. No
        one, so far as known, is in a posi?
        tion to give first hand information.
        Nor is there anything specially help?
        ful in such suggestions as emanated
        recently from one authority, who,
        when asked his opinion as to the
        population on Venus, replied with
        hopeful animation that they were
        "chorus girls." Such jocularity is
        merely beclouding the issue and add?
        ing difficulties to a problem that is
        difficult enough as it is.
        Among scientists who have won
        the righ*- to speak with authority
        . the foreu?v- was the late Professor
        Percival Lowell, director of the
        observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
        Professor Lowell was the brother
        of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, presi?
        dent of Harvard University. Be?
        fore taking charge at Flagstaff he
        had been attached to the observa?
        tory at Harvard and had conducted
        astronomical investigations in many
        parts of the world, including Japan,
        Tripoli, the Andes and other coun?
        tries. He had delivered lectures on
        his findings before important scien?
        tific societies in Great Britain and
        the United States.
        Not only was Professor Lowell
        convinced that Mars was inhabited,
        but he believed the people had a
        "?finch higher degree of intelligence
        than those on earth. He dwelt
        Particularly on their inventive
        genius.
        *i*eat Inventors
        "Quite possibly," wrote Professor
        '-owell in his book, "the Martian
        [oik are possessed of inventions of
        which we have not dreamed, and
        "With them electrophones and kineto
        scopes are things of a bygone past,
        preserved with veneration in mu?
        teras as relic? of the clumsy con?
        trivances of the simple childhood of
        the race.
        'Certainly, what we see hints at
        the existence of beings who are in
        advance of, not behind, us in the
        Journey of life.
        "Startling as the outcome of
        ?**? observations' may appear at
        -fr"*-"? in truth there ia npthing
        ?tartling about it whatever. Such
        P?ttibility has been quite on the
        ??***? ?ver aince the existence of
        -P*9HmM ?M -mocBisMd by the
        Chaldean shepherds, or whoever the
        still more primitive astronomers
        may have been. Its strangeness is
        a purely subjective phenomenon,
        arising from the instinctive reluc?
        tance of mind to admit the possi?
        bility of peers. Such would be comic
        were it not the inevitable conse?
        quence of the constitution of the
        universe. To be shy of anything
        resembling himself is part and par?
        cel of man's own individuality.
        "Like the savage, who fears noth?
        ing so much as a strange man; like
        Crusoe, who grows pale at the sight
        of footprints not his own, the civi?
        lized thinker turns from the thought
        of mind other than he himself
        knows."
        The peculiar relevancy of this
        view to the discussion resulting from
        Signor Marconi's announcement will
        strike- any one who reads Professor
        Lowell's statement. His brother
        scientists were indeed "shy," as he
        had predicted, of the deductions
        reached by him, but they at least
        contained the views of the Flagstaff
        astronomer as to the kind of people,
        who, if we accept the pleasing possi?
        bility suggested by Signor Marconi,
        are trying to "strike up a speaking
        acquaintance" with us. Not only are
        they masters in the knowledge of
        electricity, but they have already
        relegated to the museum of antiqui?
        ties many of the discoveries in that
        field which we, here on earth, look
        upon as last minute achievements in
        scientific effort.
        Professor Lowell, while comment?
        ing strongly on the intellectual at?
        tainments of the Martians, made
        little or no reference to the actual
        appearance of the folk living on that
        distant planet True, he did say in
        another part of his book that they
        probably were not interested in
        party politics, and that, judging from
        their canals, they were favored by a
        "comprehensiveness" of mind much
        more embracive than that "which
        presided over the various depart?
        ments of our own public works" in
        the United States, but as politicians
        look much like other persons very
        little could be gained from that.
        First Martian Pictures
        It was M. Edmond Perrier, direct?
        or of the museum of the Jardin des
        Plantes, in Paris, who constructed
        the first picture of the Martians, as
        he conceived them.
        At the time M. Perrier undertook
        this task the division among the au?
        thorities on Professor Lowell's the?
        ory had assumed wide p reportions.
        Some were decidedly "cold" to the
        notion that Mars?the question as to
        Venus was temporarily in eclipse?
        was inhabited at all, and they con?
        sidered it futile and profitless, there?
        fore, to attempt to depict a non-ex?
        istent people. Others, as has hap?
        pened even recently, considered the
        matter in a light vein, thinking to
        get some humor out of it, and one
        newspaper carried a cartoon, cap
        tioned "Hello Central," showing Pro?
        fessor Lowell "calling up" Mars.
        Still another group seemed to take
        it as a personal affront that the as?
        tronomer had sought to enlarge their
        list of acquaintances by introducing
        a race about which they had abso?
        lutely no knowledge.
        M. Perrier approached the problem
        from a highly speculative viewpoint,
        but made clear the fact, nevertheless,
        that he saw no reason for condemn?
        ing the position of Professor Lowell.
        "Dreams are not a crime," con?
        tended the French scholar, "and in
        this case contradiction i? difficult."
        The director of the museum of
        the Jardin des Plantes led up to his
        description of the inhabitants of
        Man by ?rtabiiahing the premia?,
        that conditions on Mars are not
        inimical to human life. Rain, snow,
        thunder and hail are known there,
        as on earth. There are seaweeds in
        the ocean, grass and trees on the
        land, fields available for cultivation
        and a friendly soil to provide food
        for the people.
        "The life which animates the
        earth also animates other planets,"
        said the French savant. "From what
        goes on around us we may divine
        what is happening elsewhere by ex?
        amining the exact conditions under
        which each planet finds itself en
        rapport with ? every other. On the
        planets which are furthegt away,
        it is impossible that human beings
        should exist, for no organism could,
        for example, be formed in the al?
        kaline seas of Jupiter, while Mer?
        cury, which is too near the sun,
        could not engender life. Only Venus,
        the Earth and Mars are habitable."
        On Mars, M. Perrier went on, life
        is "grand, intense, formidable." The
        mean temperature is 40 degrees
        Fahrenheit, as against 76 degrees
        on earth, the winters are more se?
        vere, the summers warmer, the year
        longer and the seasons more marked
        than ours.
        The sea animals are, much like
        ours, the fishes have a sense of hear?
        ing, there are insects in the animal
        kingdom and flowers and butterflies,
        but the humans are very, very differ?
        ent.
        Before going on and giving M. Per?
        ri?re picture of the kind of people
        the Martians are, and in order to re
        assure such sensitive souls as may I
        fear to establish speaking relations I
        with a people too alien in -appearance
        to make acceptable neighbors, it
        should be stated that M. Perrier does
        not agree with the conception of the
        Martians set forth by H. G. Wells in
        his book "War of the Worlds." Mr.
        Wells, in that work, caused the Mar?
        tians to resemble cuttlefish, with
        round, gray bodies, with "sort of
        faces" and long, groping tentacles.
        This conception, M. Perrier as?
        serted, did the Martians a great in?
        justice and created a prejudice
        against them, which is not only un?
        scientific and unsound, but entirely
        undeserved.
        The Martians, the French scholar
        held, bear a certain resemblance to
        man, although many of their fea?
        tures are more prominent. For this,
        the difference in the forces of grav?
        ity and in environment are chiefly
        responsible, he said. Their ears, for
        example, are very large.
        Continniug? tie? gsmtos of thai
        museum of the Jardin des Plantes]
        said:
        . "The low atmospheric pressure
        has produced a considerable devel?
        opment of the pulmonary apparatus,
        and consequently the general char?
        acter of the Martians has been in?
        fluenced by this development, which
        is unknown on earth.
        Why Martians Are Tall
        "The men on Mars are tall be?
        cause the force of gravity is slight.
        They are blond, because the daylight
        is less intense. They have less pow?
        erful limbs. They have some of the
        characteristics of our Scandinavian
        type, although they probably have
        larger skulls.
        "Their large blue eyes, theii
        strong noses, their large ears, con?
        stitute a type of beauty which we
        doubtless would not appreciate ex?
        cept as suggesting superhuman in?
        telligence."
        Going further into details, M. Per
        rier concluded that the jaw of the
        Martian is narrower than ours.be
        cause time and evolution have re
        moved him further from his anima
        forebears than they have us. His |
        lung capacity is enormous because of
        the thin atmosphere, although his
        legs are extremely thin, due to the
        little effort needed in walking. He
        has little or no neck.
        Touching on the question of intel?
        ligence, the French savant deduced
        j that ' the Martians have solved the
        problem of existence, and know no
        such thing as industrial strife. Be?
        ing older, they are also wiser than
        we. They have long since conquered
        disease, and know the hour of their
        demise, awaiting the event calmly.
        They have overcome poverty, are
        too sophisticated to engage in war,
        and need no law or government to
        keep them orderly. Philosophers
        and brothers, they live in amity and
        understanding, devoting all their
        thought to the promotion of large
        undertakings in which selfishness,
        avarice and earthly trifles have no
        part.
        They are, in a word, as different
        from tha ?*ncifui And unpieasing
        picture painted by Wells as are we
        from the Simian types referred to
        by Darwin.
        Returning to tho question of flora
        and fauna, M. Perrier concluded
        that because of the reduced force
        of gravity, animals are much larger
        on Mars than here, and hop, run
        and fly about much more easily.
        Grass is higher, fruit is bigger, and
        the flowers possess undreamed of
        beauty. The light is something lik?
        our dusk, and the general landscape
        much more attractive than on
        earth.
        "The year on Mars is twice as
        long as our earthly one," he ex?
        plained, "and hence plants and in?
        sects have twice the time in whicr
        to evolve. Mars is the land of hug?
        plants and ideal flowers, of bird;
        abnormally powerful in song an<
        wondrous in appearance, and o:
        four-footed animals with extraor?
        dinarily developed fur and skin."
        Neither M. Perrier ?or the other
        scientists who believe in the habita
        bility of other worlds paid so much
        attention to Venus. They agreed,
        however, with the head of the Jardin
        des Plantes that as this planet is
        much younger than the earth,
        life there is much less advanced.
        Because of the greater nearness to
        the sun, the climate is something
        like that in our tropics, and the air
        is always misty. Animals and plants
        are much like ours, especially at the.
        poles, where the temperature is not
        so high, but humans are not much
        beyond the development that existed
        on earth during the secondary geo?
        logical period.
        Not From Venus
        In other words, there is much less
        likelihood that those strange Marv
        coni signals came from Venus than
        that they came from Mars. j
        Having thus disposed o? the kind j
        of beings supposed to exist on the
        only two eligible planets, two other
        questions arise?Why are the Mar?
        tians or the Venusians trying to
        communicate with us, that is, if they
        are? and, What atmospheric condi?
        tions will we on earth have to over?
        come in order to reply to them?
        As to tho first question, a possible
        explanation may be found in Jtha
        so-called cataclysm on Mars that was
        I reported by the British Astronomical
        Association in 1909. In that year
        the "planet of mystery" was nearer
        to earth than at any time since 1892,
        and so in a favorable position for
        observation.
        The phenomenon which was her?
        alded as without parallel in the rec?
        ords of the past was the appearance
        of a gloomy, yellow veil which en?
        shrouded immense tracts of the Mar?
        tian surface, obliterating important
        markings.
        On account of the theory, then
        recently advanced by Professor
        Lowell, that Mars was inhabited, the
        changes aroused extraordinary inter?
        est. It previously had I*? ;i sug?
        gested that the canals on the planet
        had been constructed by a dying
        race, a race menaced by starvation
        on a desert planet, which had sought
        by means of these enormous via?
        ducts to carry water from t?e melt?
        ing ice caps at the poles, and the
        appearance of the yellow mist com?
        bined with the simultaneous erasure
        of some of the canal markings gave
        riso to the fear that a gigantic
        i
        Professor Lowell Held That Mar?
        tians Were Far Advanced in
        Inventions and Science
        catastrophe had occurred, the effects
        of which were only too apparent.
        Can it be, some of the observers
        of conditions now are asking, that
        CCIENTISTS agree that
        *"* the people of Mars differ
        from us in many ways. The
        Martians are believed to
        have very large noses and
        ears and immense lung de?
        velopment, because of the
        rarefied atmosphere. Their
        legs are poorly developed, be?
        cause matter on Mars weighs
        less than here and sturdy
        legs are not needed to bear
        their weight. Birds and but?
        terflies are very large and j
        beautiful
        ?some such similar catastrophe has j
        overtaken the Martians, who, in
        their desperation, are attempting to
        communicate the fact to us?
        In August, 1909, astronomers
        working at their telescopes had re?
        ported what they surmised to be a
        new fracture of the southern polar
        cap and the appearance of a dark
        streak along the line of the break.
        About the same time a brilliant spot,
        which may have been a segment of
        the shattered terrain, had- separated
        itself from the polar cap and had
        moved over to one of the dusky
        areas of the planet, partly hiding it
        from view.
        Great Convulsion Possible
        All this seemed to strengthen the
        theory of a huge convulsion ad?
        vanced by the British scientists, al?
        though, as seems to be the fate of all
        questions concerning this much dis?
        cussed and little understood celes?
        tial body, eminent authorities at
        once took opposing ground on the
        subject.
        Professor Harold Jacoby, Ruther?
        ford Professor of Astronomy at
        Columbia University, contended that
        "the Martians are not likely to have
        their world destroyed any more than
        are we," adding that if any such
        catastrophe as hinted had actually
        occurred the news would have be?
        come known through some quicker
        channel than the British Astro?
        nomical Association. By this, it
        should be explained hastily, Profes?
        sor Jacoby did not mean that the
        scientists across the Atlantic were
        slower in observation than others,
        | but only that the disaster would
        have been revealed by telescopes
        ! everywhere long before a formal
        | report could have been prepared.
        Professor F. R. Moulton, of the
        ! University of Chicago, also doubted
        the accuracy of the report, and Pro?
        fessor Lowell himself, author of the
        notion that Mars is inhabited, was
        not particularly impressed with it. .
        Professor Lowell, it will be re?
        membered, held to the belief that
        the Martians were anything but a
        starving, needy people, and he con?
        stantly sought to fortify his posi?
        tion by offering new proofs of their
        prosperity, advancement and skill.
        In 1914 he found a new opportunity
        for strengthening his pet belief by
        announcing that instead of losing
        any of their canals the Martians
        had built two new ones, which could
        be seen plainly through the tele?
        scope.
        "We have actually seen them
        formed under our eyes," Professor
        | Lowell said at the time, "and the
        | importance of it car. hardly be over?
        estimated. Tho phenomenon tran?
        scends any natural law, and is only
        explicable sc far as can be seen by
        the presence out yonder of animate
        will." By animate will he meant, of
        course, human beings.
        Professor Lowell was admittedly
        tho leading spokesman for the
        Martians, and anything he said
        was worthy of the moat respectful
        consideration, but in view of recent
        developments many thinkers are
        asking if, after all, he was not mis?
        taken in at least one particular,
        and if the "signals" picked up in
        New York and London were not
        efforts on their part to notify the
        earth folk of their desperate plight.
        Xo unusual manifestations to sup?
        port this view have been witnessed
        recently on the distant planet, but?
        it is at least a new guess on the
        subject, which is all that its origi?
        nators claim for it.
        Tesla Believes It
        To Nikola Tesla there is nothing
        remarkable or impossible in the sug?
        gestion that the mysterious signals
        are from the Martians. Discussing
        the question, he said:
        "To most people the mere idea of
        flashing a signal over the immense
        gulf of 50,000,000 or 100,000,000
        miles will naturally appear prepos?
        terous, but as I have stated in an
        article I wrote for 'The Harvard
        Illustrated Magazine' of March,
        1907, it is simply a feat of electrical
        engineering, apparently hazardous,
        but made perfectly feasible through
        inventions with which the experts
        are familiar.
        "That the planets are inhabited is
        a foregone conclusion. It would be
        stupid to deny the existence of con?
        ditions suitable for the development
        of organic life on other plftnet3."
        The next question is how the
        earth is to reply to these signals,
        supposing they are signals at all
        and what are the atmospheric ob
        s-itacles that will have to be over
        come.
        Mars at times is only 50,000,00
        miles away from the earth and a
        other times 250,000,000. ft is frc
        quently surrounded by vapors, a

        the creation of a wireless apparatui
        of sufficient strength to send a mes
        sage over the required distance
        Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, chief con
        suiting engineer of the Genera
        Electric Company, believes such ai
        instrument possible, provided tb
        world devoted itself to the inventioi
        with the same thoroughness it em
        ployed in the great war, but esti

        a part, said that signals had bee

        "But there is one thing thi

        practicalities in sending a wirelt

        may say, is something about whi
        the newspaper men know almost
        much as we do. But the ch
        problem, it would seem to me, w??
        be to find an instrument power
        enough, rather than anything el

        IF the patience of the folk on Mars
        endures a little longer they finally
        may succeed in their attempts to
        get into communication with us. Marconi
        of the wireless is comine here next
        month to "listen" in on the messages he
        believes are being flung through the
        ether from the mysterious planet of
        canals and supermen.
        What will be the first message from
        Mars? Even the imaginations of the
        stolid scientists are stirred by this fantastic
        attempt of Marconi. For years
        scientists have attempted to perfect
        some means of interplanetary communication,
        ranging from immense rockets
        to giant heliographs?and now radio.
        Prof. Goddard of Clark College,
        Massachusetts, at one time put forward
        the suggestion that a giant rocket be
        launched to the moon. But for the fact
        that the idea appeared to be fathered by
        the Smithsonian Institution ii would have
        met only ridicule in scientific circles.
        But given the Smithsonian
        tuci O
        was considerable discussion of this plan
        until some one ventured to inquire what
        was going to shoot the rocket off.
        Projection of bright rays of light into
        the sky, either by powerful searchlights
        of tremendous power or by a gigantic
        heliograph system of mirror:, placed in
        some such locality as the Sahara Desert,
        at one time appealed to science as the
        most feasible way to establish communications
        with Mars. Early in 1920 Preston
        B. Bassett, research engineer of the
        Sperry Gyroscope Company of Brooklyn,
        asserted that there was no reason such a
        method should not be entirely feasible.
        Mr. Bassett, one of many who backed
        the light system of communication with
        he other planets, proposed the concentration
        of the rays of 120 high intensity
        searchlights of 1,000,000,000 candle-power
        each into a single beam of 120,000,000,000
        candle-power intensity, which would result
        in a signal which, he claimed, could
        be easily read on Mars, provided that
        planet was Inhabited and that the inhabitants
        possessed telescopic instruments of
        equal strength to those used on earth.
        But all methods suggested have been
        proved impracticable even before given a
        test. Radio seems to hold out the most
        hope. Radio, Marconi reminds, gave science
        our first real hope of interplanetary
        communication
        One night in January, 19<^ Marconi
        operators in several different wireless
        stations, of which the most important
        was the London station, were siaftled by
        a series of "mysterious" messages of extraordinary
        wave length which tney could
        not trace.
        The operators wondered, unable to explain
        these strange signals. Finally it
        was observed that they were receiving a
        series of S's. The "toe?toe?toe" was in
        reality three dots, which In Morse code
        represents the letter S. Each message
        consisted of a group of three S's.
        Later a query was broadcasted to wireless
        stations the world over in an attempt
        to find the source of the phantom signals.
        It was found the messages were of no
        "Could It be Mars?" a startled world
        aRked Itself. And In answer a controversy
        arose with one side defending the
        Mars theory and the other bitterly opposing
        It with explanations of "atmos- 1
        pherlc discharges," "magnetic storms," |
        "thunder storms on the sun'" ?nd other I
        natural phenomena. <
        Marconi at the time said: "I vould be
        a bold speculator were I to dt.-lire posl- i
        tively that one or more of the planets i
        are attempting to send us some kind of <
        messages, but it is equally futile to deny i
        that such a thing Is possible, iu view of t

        "What actually has happened in th
        throbbing mystery is that signals hai
        been received which apparently are di
        to electro-magnetic waves of grei-t lengi
        which are not merely stray signals."
        Interest was revived in intero.anetai
        communication?even in the minds <
        thoso most skeptical of the source of tl
        mysterloUR messages. Efforts were mat
        to And the most feasible way to cast ele<
        trie waves across the limitless inte
        stellar spaces.
        Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, the enginee
        lng wizard of the Ceneral Electric Cor
        pany and recent inventor of "synthetk
        lightning, at the time estimated that
        wireless plant powerful enough to cast
        wave length capable of reaching Mai
        would cost $1,000,000,000 to construct ar
        require from the whole country the sarr
        degree of energy and thoroughness wit
        which it entered the war. Lofty tower
        1,000 feet high, would have to be coi
        structed and all the electric power of tl
        country would have to be concentrate
        into one great power plant or sendir
        station. He also said that metal balloor
        filled with helium gas and sent up se>
        eral thousand feet could be used instea
        of the 1,000 feet high towers, whic
        might prove cumbersome to construct.
        If such a station should he built, th
        resultant wave length would be beyond a
        previous conjecture. Wave lengths c
        r.,000 miles, while not common, are ofte
        cast and signals have been sent as far a
        10,000 miles under unusual circun
        dances. However, there are a grea
        many atmospheric conditions still to b
        contended with, even when sending
        message a short distance, and even if

        the planet would thus be observed, it Is
        true, and the spot would be moving
        rapidjy past the telescope, but enough
        could probably be observed to insure
        h some positive conclusions. In 1924
        s Mars will be within 35,000,000 miles or
        e the earth, so that observations made at
        i- that time would be under the most
        t favorable conditions,
        i- Judging from past performances, it appears
        that if communication is to be esn
        tablished between the two planets Mars
        a will have to take the initiative. We have
        > a long way to go before we develop a wave
        s length that will jump the 35,000,000 to
        r 250,000.000 miles gap.
        e But now comes Signor Marconi to the
        0 United States, where radio has developed
        1- in leaps and bounds during the last year
        s or so. If he is to succeed in catching the

        Probably the most serious difficulty,
        aside from the engineering features of
        the strange groping through space of two
        planets, Is the lack of a common medium
        for the exchange of thought. However,
        if the Martians can generate a wave
        length to reach from their planet to ours.
        It Is possible that they will be of such
        super-mentality that they will easily overcome
        this drawback.
        Again the question, "What will be the
        first message from Ma$s?" Injects itself.
        What will It reveal?
        Will It plunge our earth back a thousand
        years? Will it make our radio, telephonic
        and telegraphic systems seem, by
        comparison with those of Mars, to be as
        crude as the smoke signals of the Indian
        or the tomtom wireless of the African
        bushman? Such questions as these are,
        indeed, fearful to contemplate.
        And how about the Martian himself?
        the subject of so much earthly speculation?
        Will he be, as II. G. Wells describes
        him In his book "War of the Worlds," a
        cross between a cuttlefish and a monkey,
        with a round grayish body, with a "sort
        of a face" and long, groping tentacles?a
        gruesome, hideous thing to look upon? Or
        will he be, as Edmond Perrler, director of
        the Museum of the Jardlne des Plantes
        and constructor of the first picture of the
        Martian, describes him? The French
        scholar held that the Martian bears a certain
        resemblance to man, although many

        "The life which animates the earth also
        animates the other planets. Prom what
        goes on around us we may divine what
        is happening elsewhere by examining conditions
        under which each planet finds itself
        en rapport with every other. On the
        planets which are farthest away it is impossible
        that human beings should exist,
        for no organism could, for example, be
        found in the alkaline wastes of Jupiter,
        while Mercury, which is too near the Sun,
        could not engender life. Only Venus, the
        Earth and Mars are inhabitable.
        "The low atmospheric pressure has pro- i
        duced considerable development of the
        pulmonary apparatus, and consequently
        the general character of the Martians has
        been influenced by this development,
        which is unknown on earth.

        THE Field Museum in Chicago once
        became infested with a large
        number of obnoxious spiders.
        They feBtooned the celling and great columns
        of the building with yards of their
        shuttle work. Scrubwomen and Janitors
        tried in vain to rid the building of the
        pests and their work. Finally a small
        bird, known as the brown creeper, discovered
        the state of things and decided
        to take up its abode inside and Rssist the
        authorities in ridding the building of the
        pestB. I
        For several days the bird flitted about
        very much as it pleased, wagging up and 1
        down column after column and probing 1
        its bill into every crevice, and he actually
        carried on a very effective work. i
        One morning, however, as an official i
        of the museum was passing, an attendant 1
        remarked to him that it looked very much i
        as if the bird were done for, and a subject
        for the museum's collection. Olanc- I

        appreciate except as suggesting superhuman
        intelligence."
        He has further stated that the Martians
        live in an intellectual Utopia?a Utopia
        that is all the name implies.
        Prof. Lowell, director of the observatory
        at Flagstaff, Ariz., and one of the
        greatest authorities on Mars, places the
        Martian people on a much higher intellectual
        plane than those on earth.
        "Quite possibly," Prof. Lowell has written,
        "the Martian folk are possessed of inventions
        of which we have not dreamed,
        and with them electrophones and kinetoscopes
        are things of a bygone past, preserved
        with the veneration in the museums
        as relics of the clumsy contrivances
        of the simple childhood of the race.
        "Certainly what we see hints at the existence
        of beings who are in advance of *
        not behind us in the journey of life."
        The canal system of Mars indicates that
        the planet's inhabitants' are a race of
        super-engineers. If they outshine us men- '
        tally as much as Prof. Lowell claims, we
        can expect to find that our "modern" and
        much boasted of buildings are as the
        tepees of the Sioux, our engineering
        works no further advanced than the
        dams of the beaver, our inventions as
        9lmple as children's toys.
        ovel Bird Trap
        tendant the officer saw that the bird lay
        panting on Its side at the bottom of one
        of the columns.
        "Catch a fly," said the scientist to his
        attendant, as he took the bird into his
        hands. The fly soon being forthcoming,
        it was held on the point of a pin to the
        bird's beak, and to the surprise of both
        men the creeper bit at it voraciously.
        That didn't look as If the little fellow
        were about to die. The scientist was
        much perplexed and wondered what was
        the matter with the bird.
        Then, turning the bird over in his hand,
        lie found it had been entrapped In a
        arge spider's web, which had bound the
        wing and tail together In such a manner
        as to preclude flying. It looked as if
        jome old, wise spider had resented the
        bird's work of extermination and had
        purposely ensnnred him in a trap.
        The queer bandage was removed and
        ;he bird darted out of the building and
        was soon lost to Bight.

        Dying Planet That Seem to
        Show the Martians Must Soon
        Find Means to Move to
        Some Better World or Be Wiped

        How the Telescopes
        on Earth Showed the
        Firing of the Projec
        tile* in Which the
        First Invaders from
        Mars Were Shot Out Into Space.
        By Dr. W. H. Ballou.
        THE reports of the leading astrono
        mers show that the condition! of
        life on the planet Mart at the pres
        ent moment are becoming increasingly
        hard and that if the planet is inhabited,
        as appears probable, its people must now
        be seeking some way of escape from their
        miseries.
        We are therefore confronted by the
        possibility that has often been discussed
        '>y imaginative scientists and others?a
        descent upon the earth by the inhabitants
        of Mars. Professor I/Owell, Professor
        Pickering, Camille Flammarion and other
        scientists, as well as H. G. Wells, have
        pointed out that if the means of life were
        failing on any planet it was logical to
        expect the inhabitants would try to move
        to some other planet. The only
        question is how they would
        move, und Mr. Wells may have
        solved that problem.
        Mart at the present moment
        r>T?-rs unusual opportunities for
        observation to the astronomer, as
        it is nearer to the earth than it
        !i;ts V?een for many ypars. It is
        mow only 42,350,000 miles away,
        "hereas at this time last year It
        vas 200.000,000 miles away!
        Two years from now Mars will
        l-e only 34.P00.000 miles away.
        If they cannot attack us
        this year, the Martians,
        having suffered unbear
        able miseries, will, per
        haps, have perfected their
        arrangements in the two
        year period and may then
        descend upon the earth in
        devastating myriads.
        Summer on Mars has now passed, and
        even ordinary telescopes show that the
        ice and snow cap around the poles of
        Mars have spread further than ever, add
        ing to the hardships of life on an ordi
        narily cold and arid planet.
        There is ample scientific evidence for
        conjecturing that life on Mars has now
        become a long agony which no earthly
        creature could endure, and which even the
        Martians, who have undergone ages of
        adaptation, are finding unbearable.
        Incessantly swept by terrible dust
        storms, unable to find sufficient nourish
        ment on an arid, froten globe, gasping
        for breath in an exhausted atmosphere,
        unable to find even water, the Martians
        are living in an inferno that only the pen
        of a Dante could describe.
        All the evidence indicates that the Mar
        tians must soon make a wholesale migra
        tion to the earth or some other favorable
        planet in the manner that imaginative
        writers have suggested. Unless they do
        so, they are faced with speedy annihila
        tion.
        This tragic situation lends great inter
        est to the new illustrations Jnade by a
        brilliant European artist, Alvim Correa,
        for a French edition of H. G. Wells' "War
        of the Worlds." It will be remembered
        that in this famous work the Martians,
        luing threatened with extinction, brcan
        shooting themselves to the earth in vast
        numbers.
        They were all brain and no bones and
        shaped much like giant octopuses. To
        compensate for the lack of skeleton, their
        bodies were enclosed in circular metal
        cases and moved on enormous metal stilts
        They nourished themselves on Mars by
        transfusing blood from the bodies of man
        like creatures. When they reached earth
        they used men for food purposes and
        were rapidly destroying the helpless popu
        lation. They rapidly conquered London
        and other important regions.
        But on Mars the Martians had liv#d
        entirely without disease germs and con
        sequently possessed no acquired immunity
        to them. With the blood of human beings
        they drew in the germs of death and
        rapidly succumbed without a struggle.
        They had command of a burning ray,
        which instantly shrivelled up any object
        which it touchcd. ?
        When the Martian invaders needed
        food they picked up human beings in their
        long tentacles, transferred their blood to
        themselves and threw their empty car
        casses away. /

        no such , weapon was in existence when
        Wells wrote his hook.
        "As recently as the Boer war, which
        happened after Wells wrote his book, ar

        tranches and all kinds of recesses. It is
        certain to hit tanks, armored ears and
        other moving objects. ,
        "Progressive military men art the flrat
        to admit that Wells pointed the way' to
        tremendously improved methods of war.

        are convinced that the Martian atmos
        phere is very rarefied, as compared with
        that of the earth. The amount of water
        vapor there ia so small that for many
        years its existence was rather guessed
        at than proved. It is so scanty that no
        clouds can form thick enough to be visible
        to our telescopes in most earthly coun
        tries, but in the clear air of Arizona the
        Doctors Rlipher have repeatedly observed
        a kind of mist differing quite noticeably
        from the fierce dust storms that prevail
        upon Mars from time to time.
        Thus the latest observations tend to
        support the scientific hypothesis of Pro
        fessor Lowell that there is an atmosphere
        of sufficient density to support the life of

        Professor Lowell
        stated that Mars Is level
        and monotonous, with no
        mountains and only a few
        dried-up beds of shallow

        seas to diversify its topography. More
        , than one-half of Mars is a dreary desert,
        and the rest is green only when the canals
        are bringing water from the Polar ice
        capa. He first described the great dust
        rtorms which sweep over its equatorial
        section, blotting out hundreds of square
        miles of the planet's surface from our
        view.
        The physical conditions on Mars are
        very different from those we have on
        earth. The force of gravity exerted on
        Mars is only three-eighths of that on. the
        earth, while the atmospheric pressure that
        is about fifteen pounds to the square inch
        at sea level on earth is less than fo*ur
        pounds on Mars. This would make it
        possible for enormous weights to be lifted
        on Mars with. little muscular effort, as
        compared with the tasks on our planet.
        Lowell figured that Martians could do
        seven times more work than human beings
        on earth with the same amount of effort.'
        An elephant could leap like a gatelle
        there, and a stone thrown into the air
        would go very high and sink with a slow,
        graceful motion, much like the apparent
        action of a slowed-up movie camera.
        The supposed signals from Mars, which
        Marconi believed he had received on his
        yacht Electra this Summer, may well have
        something to do with distress on that
        planet, although a different explanation
        of them has been furnished.
        It is commonly assumed that the Mar
        tian, if he exists at all, has a much older
        civilization than our own. The basis for
        this assumption is the nebular hypothesis,
        according to which the various planets
        were thrown off in succession from the
        mass of world-stuff which contracted as
        it cooled, with the sun at its centre. On
        this thesis thfe outer planets would ob
        viously be older and Mars would presum
        ably have been far ahead of us in de
        veloping a living population.
        We might fairly expect our elder plan
        etary brother to take the initiative in
        sending signals to the earth. Radio,
        which is new with us, may bo an old, old
        story with the Martians. Quite possibly
        they have been patiently waiting thou
        sands of years for us to become intellir.
        gent enough to answer their signals.
        If the Martian exists, and if he has a
        radio system that can reach the earth, ho
        should have no difficulty in revealing him
        self to us. Nothing more itrould be neces
        sary than to send a series of signals at
        fixed intervals. If. for example, ne were
        to make two ?ipnsls, then after an inter
        val two more, and after a doable interval,
        four signals, we should know that he was ;
        proving that he could add two and two.

        Zs tie Planet Mars Really Ruled A Giant

        by a Kace of Beavers
        .
        mi
        :
        SINCE scientists, after years of
        earnest and competent research,
        have been unable to detect one
        clear sign of manlike life on Mars, an
        amazing theory is now being presented
        to explain why the red planet may be
        inhabited by a race of beavers. It is
        a fascinating story of evolution.
        Man and man's active mind are be
        lieved to be products of the Great Ice
        Age, for that time of stress and com
        petition on earth is what is supposed
        to have turned mankind's anthropoid
        How Butter Was
        Discovered
        AN Aryan horseman galloped
        across an Asian plain one day
        thousands of years ago, and dis
        covered butter. This important event
        wa3 one of those fortunate accidents
        that have contributed so much to the
        progress of man. It happened like
        this, according to James A. Toby,
        writing in Hygeia:
        When the horseman started he had
        with him a goatskin filled with sour
        milk. The journey was long and
        rough, the day moderately hot. When
        he reached his destination and dis
        mounted, seeking to appease hunger
        and thirst, the Aryan was bewildered
        to find something in his goatskin that
        was unlike the milk he started with.
        With some trepidation, for the acts
        of the gods were often mysterious in
        those days, he tasted the yellow mass.
        Then he tasted it again, for it was
        good. He told other herdsmen, who
        probably scoffed at him as a fool, as
        is customary when new benefits are
        announced, but eventually they, too,
        tried the product of the galloping
        churn.
        Soon the tribe was making butter,
        hanging up the goatskins filled with
        sour milk and beating them with
        sticks or shaking them until the golden
        mass appeared. That is the way but
        ter is made to this day in some parts
        o the world.

        ancestors' into men. The
        period of ice and cold
        over wide areas of the
        earth was caused, at least
        in part, by the elevation
        of continents and mount
        ain ranges. On Mars, no
        mountain ranges exist,
        and it probably never had
        an Ice Age.
        It is on these hypoth
        eses, as Thomas Elway
        explains in Popular
        Science Monthly, that
        science bases its assump
        tion that there is no hu
        man intelligence on Mars,
        and that animal life on
        the planet is still in the

        "The chief reason to expect this final
        change of Martian reptiles into primi
        tive mammals," says Mr. Elway, "lies
        in the fact that on earth this evolution
        seems to have been forced by change
        able weather. And Mars now.possesses
        seasonal changes like those on earth.
        "Pure biological reasoning makes it
        probable, therefore, that the evolution
        of warm-blooded animals may have oc
        curred on Mars much as it did here.
        There seeni3 no reason to believe that
        Martian life has gone farther than that.
        Mars is a relatively changeless planet.
        Biologists suppose that the rise and fall
        of mountains, the increase and decrease
        in volcanic activity, and the ebb and
        flow of climate forced life on earth
        along its upward path. Martian life
        of recent ages seems to have lacked
        these natural incentives to better
        things.

        Benjamin F. Court, of Long Beach.

        The handle of the knife is U-shaped
        in cross-section, so that it will con
        veniently fit over the handle of the
        scissors blade.
        A flat leaf spring inside the knife
        handle exerts a pressure tending to
        spread the two handles apart, and thus
        open the device for use as a scissors.
        On the other hand, a simple catch,
        readily adjusted with a finger, locks
        the handles together, so that the imple

        MUSK OXEN
        THE United States Department of
        Agriculture has newly pur
        chased in Greenland thirty
        musk oxen, which are to be shipped
        to the town of Fairbanks, Alaska.
        The aim in view is to restock Alaska
        with these dwarf wild cattle, which
        formerly were fairly numerous in that
        Territory, but which are no longer
        found there, having been wiped out
        by ruthless slaughter. They are de
        sirable animals, their meat being ex
        cellent for food.
        It is not intended to domesticate
        them in Alaska. The small herd of
        thirty is to be set at liberty near
        Fairbanks, where there is a reindeer
        station. Rigid enforcement of game
        laws is expected to give the musk
        oxen requisite protection. Other ship
        ments from Greenland are contem
        plated, and the natural increase of the
        for the development of whose counter
        part the supposed Martian conditions
        would be ideal. That animal is the
        beaver. It is either land-living or water
        living. It has a fur coat to protect it
        from the 100 degrees below zero of
        the Martian night.
        "Martian beavers, of course, would
        not be exactly like those on earth. That
        they would be furred and water-loving
        is probable. Their eyes might be larger
        than those of the earthly beaver be
        cause the sunlight is not so strong, and
        their bodies might be larger because of
        lesser Martian gravity. Competent dig
        ging tools certainly would be provided
        on their claws. The chests of these
        Martian beavers would be larger and
        their breathing far more active, as
        there is less oxygen in the air on Mars.
        "Such beaver-Martians are nothing
        more than pure speculation, but the
        idea is based upon the known facts that
        there is plenty of water on Mars; that
        vegetation almost certainly exists there;
        that Mars has no mountains and could
        scarcely have had an Ice Age; and that
        evidences of Martian life are not ac
        companied by signs of intelligence.
        "Herds of .beaver-creatures are at
        least a more reasonable idea than the
        familiar fictional one of manlike Mar
        tians digging artificial water channels
        with vast machines or the still more
        fantastic notion of octopuslike Martians
        sufficiently intelligent to plan the con
        quest of the earth."
        Any deduction about the life forms
        on Mars or other planets, in the opinion
        of leading astronomers, must start, if
        it is to be at all reasonable, with the
        idea of the distinguished Swedish scien
        tist. Dr. Svante Arrhenius, of one kind
        of life-germ pervading the entire solar
        system. There is no reasonable way

        animals by breeding is counted on to
        do the rest.
        There has already been established
        at the reindeer station near Fairanks
        a sizable herd of buffalo, which seems
        to find the climate suitable, and which
        is showing a satisfactory increase.
        There are, as is well known, herds of
        buffalo in several of the national parks
        of the United States, and, with the
        present outlook, there is no reason to
        apprehend the extinction of the
        American bison.
        The musk ox has never been do
        mesticated. It is properly native to
        latitudes adjacent to the Arctic Circle
        all around the world. Its hair has the
        fineness of silk, and is stronger than
        linen fiber. An outer coat, so long
        that it almost trails on the ground, is
        thed in Summer.
        In Arctic regions the silken hair of
        the animal is woven into delicate fab
        rice for garments, which are worn by
        tribal chiefs.

        even to guess the form of this life
        germ. It may, perhaps, have drifted,
        a tiny living spores, from planet to
        planet, whirled through space by the
        pressure of light.
        Whatever its form, the life-germ,
        biologists assume, probably developed
        on Mars, much as it did on earth, in
        oceans which have evaporated in the
        course of ages.
        The theory that Martian life evolved
        along lines similar to those followed by
        evolution of life on earth is supported
        by at least one definite fact. Careful
        spectroscopic studies at Mt. Wilson Ob
        servatory, near Pasadena, Calif., and
        elsewhere have disclosed that gaseous
        oxygen exists in the Martian atmos
        phere. The presence of oxygen gas is
        highly significant, since the only known
        way in which any planet can obtain
        supply of this gas is through the life
        activities of plants.
        Following the lead of the great ex
        pert in Martian astronomy, the late
        Professor Percival Lowell, astronomers
        long have recognized on Mars dark
        colored spots and markings which are
        believed to be plains or valleys covered
        with vegetation. The oxygen which
        spectroscopes show in the Martian air
        is taken as another proof that this
        vegetation exists.
        Since the activity of plants is the.
        II A. EDOrA
        only known process of cosmic chemis
        try by which free oxygen can be pro
        duced on the surface of a cooled planet,
        the presence of oxygen in the rarefied
        air of Mars indicates that vegetation
        there must have produced oxygen out
        of water and sunlight as it has done on
        earth. It is difficult to exaggerate the
        importance to Martian theorizing of
        the definite fact that Mars has oxygen
        and, therefore, vegetation.
        One of the best signs of intelligence
        on Mars, Dr. Clyde Fisher, of the
        T
        HAT animals feed upon plants
        . i . ,,, u.
        every one takes lor g anted, but
        that there are some plants which
        feed upon animal-lifo is quite a dif-
        fcrent story. If the great Darwin
        called Dionaea the "most wonderful
        plant in the world," he might bettcr
        have termed it the "most savage plant
        on earth." for it has proved its blood
        thirstiness wherever found.
        Originally Dionaea muscipula, more
        popularly known as "Venus'.- l'!y-trap,"
        was discovered in North Carolina, and
        it was at first doubted that this or any
        other plant could live upon insects
        chiefly, but later study of its habits
        has proved beyond peradventure that
        this is the great cannibal-plant, with an
        almost unappeasable appetite for flies,
        spiders, beetles or any other insects
        which are so stupid as to alight upon
        A Savage PLANT That Devours FLESH
        Turning THUNDER Into MUSIC
        USICAL thunder, accompanied
        by a vivid electrical display,
        was encountered by radio en
        gineers recently in experiments with
        high-powered short-wave broadcasting.
        The thunder, created artificially, was
        converted into music corresponding to
        the input at the radio microphone, ac
        cording to Popular Mechanics. In hand
        ling powers above fifteen kilowatts
        on the short waves, the engineers
        found that vivid coronas flashed when
        Service.
        American Museum ot Natural History,
        New York City, said recently, would
        be some indication of artificial light on
        the planet. Undoubtedly, lighted cities
        on Mars could be seen through the tele
        scopes now in use.
        However, as Mr. Elway points out,
        there is one condition that prevents
        satisfactory and conclusive observa
        tion. When Mars is closest to the earth,
        both planets are on the sane side of
        the sun. Then only the sunlit side of
        Mars is seen. To see any part of the
        night side of Mars, observation must be
        made when it is part way around in its
        orbit toward the far side of the sun, so
        that a slice of both the dark and the
        lighted sides can be seen.
        When even a part of the night side is
        visible. Mars is relatively far away and
        difficult to sec clearly. The Martians,
        if there are any, would not have equal
        difficulty in observing the dark side of
        the earth, for when the two planets are
        nearest to each other, the earth is show
        ing Mars its dark side.
        These consequences of the orbits in
        which the two planets move might make
        it difficult for the dim glow of lighted
        Martian villages, were any such in ex
        istence, to be detected from the earth.
        Cities as bright as New York or Paris,
        on the other hand, undoubtedly would
        be visible.
        Other students of the subject, how
        ever, say it is possible that Martian
        civilization may correspond to that of
        an earlier, pre-artificial light era on
        earth. In any case, astronomers agree
        that there is a practical certainty that
        Mars possesses kinds of life below hu
        man intelligence.

        Life OnThe Planet Mars
        mosphere of Mars of half this amount, or
        120 miles.
        Mars, then, has an atmosphere, as has
        been suspected from other considerations,
        and. moreover, an atmosphere of consider
        able extent, though the low gravity at the
        surface of the planet would make it much
        less dense than that of the earth.
        Another interesting conclusion drawn
        from a study of the ultra-violet photo
        graphs is that the greater size and extent
        of the planet’s polar cap in these photo
        graphs, as compared with those taken in
        infra-red light, indicate that the polar cap
        is largely composed of cloud and haze
        overhanging the surface snow cap shown
        in the infra-red photographs.
        No less important than the observa
        tions made at the Lick Observatory are
        the determinations of the temperature of
        the Martian surface that were made by
        Dr. W. W. Coblenz, of the Bureau of Stan
        dards, Washington, D. C., at the Lowell
        Observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz., with the
        co-operation and assistance of astrono
        mers of the Lowell Observatory staff.
        With a remarkable little instrument
        known as the vacuum thermocouple, which
        gives promise of becoming one of the most
        valuable instruments yet devised for
        studying the surfaces of the planets when
        used in conjunction with powerful re
        flecting telescopes, Dr. Coblentz and his
        colleagues have been finding out the tem
        perature of various regions on the sur
        face of Mars.
        The most important result of these ob
        servations has been to show that the tem
        perature of the Martian surface rises well
        above the freezing point for considerable
        periods at a time. This is quite contrary
        to the earlier mathematical calculations
        based solely upon the known distance of
        the planet from the sun, which placed
        the surface temperature of Mars far be
        low the freezing point, and so gave a basis
        for the widespread belief that it was im
        possible for life to exist on Mars because
        of the intense and continuous cold.
        The results of Dr. Coblentz’s obser
        vations show that the temperature at the
        equator of Mars at noonday rises to 60
        or 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and is to be
        compared with that of a clear Spring day
        on our own planet in the latitude of New
        York.
        These results are well in accord with
        the visual observations of the planet
        which shows that the temperature of Mars
        must rise above the freezing point, since
        the polar caps melt and are surrounded
        by a dark band, due, presumably, to the
        release of water at the advent of Spring.
        The fact that snow is never seen at the
        Martian equator at noon, though visible
        frequently at sunrise and sunset, also
        shows that the noonday temperature must
        rise far above freezing at the equator.
        Measurements on the sunrise and sun
        set sides of the planet’s surface show, how
        ever, that the daily range of temperature
        on Mars is very great. As an example,
        on the day when Mars was nearest the
        earth in 1924 the measurements showed
        that the temperature at sunrise at the
        equator was 50 degrees below zero Fah
        renheit. At noonday in the brighter equa
        torial regions, which correspond apparent
        ly to our sandy deserts, it was 40 degrees
        Fahrenheit, and on adjacent dark mark
        ings, assumed to be vegetational tracts, it
        was 50 degrees. At sunset the tempera
        ture had dropped to freezing, or 32 de
        grees. This great daily range of tempera
        ture must be taken account of in specu
        lating upon the kind of animal or vege
        tational life that may exist on Mars, as
        Dr. Coblentz has pointed out in consider
        ing the possibilities of life there.
        The Martian inhabitant must be so
        constituted that he can resist great daily
        extremes of heat and cold. That is, he
        needs be a hibernating creature, able to
        remain dormant during periods of intense
        cold, and, at the same time, unless he is
        able to regulate his water supply by arti-

        that he could withstand long periods of
        drought.
        It requires no great stretch of imagina
        tion for us to picture such forms of life
        existent in other worlds, for we are not
        totally unfamiliar with them on our own
        planet? The camel can go for long periods
        without water. Toads and turtles and in
        sects, as well as many other living crea
        tures, remain torpid or dormant during
        periods of prolonged cold, and it is pos
        sible also to picture life on Mars adapted
        to short hot periods alternating with pe
        rieds of intense cold far below freezing.
        Alpine plants, when in full bloom, sur
        vive the intensely cold nights in a stiffly
        frozen state. Mosses and lichens flourish
        under Arctic snows. Vividly colored
        flowers bloom in the short Alaskan Sum
        mer and in the clear, cold, dry atmosphere
        of the Tibetan plateau.
        The little metallic receiver of the
        vacuum thermocouple which is exposed to
        the radiations of the Martian surface is
        no greater in diameter than a period, but
        the unmagnified image of the planet
        formed within the telescope is only eight
        times greater in diameter, or about one
        sixteenth of one inch. So it is possible
        by exposing this little disc to different
        portions of the Martian surface to deter
        mine the relative temperature of differ
        ent regions several hundred miles in dia
        meter.
        In this way it has been found that the

        of heat during the Martian day which may
        aid somewhat in offsetting the intense and
        bitter cold of the Martian night, just as
        on our own planet heat stored up by day
        is radiated at night and serves to keep
        down the extremes of temperature be
        tween day and night.
        The far greater rareness of the Mar
        tian atmosphere would cause a rapid
        radiation of this heat to space, however,
        and the temperature of the Martian night
        must often drop to 100 degrees below
        zero, Fahrenheit. Only by “digging in” or
        remaining torpid could Martian life resist
        such extremes of daily temperature.
        Another interesting result of the
        measurement of the radiation from limit
        ed areas of the Martian surface has been
        to show that dark areas at the equator,
        presumably vegetational growth, are fully
        20 degrees hotter than bright regions in
        the same latitude. As the more brilliantly
        reflecting regions are believed to be sandy
        deserts, this is the reverse of conditions
        here, where the desert regions are far
        hotter than the regions that are clothed
        with vegetation.
        An explanation for this may be found,
        it is Dr. Coblentz’s belief, either in the
        fact that the dark regions may be at some
        what lower levels than surrounding desert
        tracts or the vegetational growth on Mars
        may be similar in its absorptions of heat
        to that of the Siberian tundras or the
        tuft or tussock grasses of the Falkland
        Islands and Patagonia, which grow to a
        h< ight of five feet or over and strongly
        absorb heat from the sun. The vegeta
        tion found growing on the Siberian tun-
        dras is luxuriant and beautifully colored,
        but it is separated from subterranean ice
        beds only by the decayed growth of previ
        ous years, which serves to protect it. In
        midsummer this vegetation strongly ab
        sorbs the rays of the sun and becomes
        extremely hot by day, but at night it en
        dures a temperature that falls consider
        ably below the freezing point.
        It is possible that the polar regions of
        Mars may be even better adapted to sup
        port life than the equatorial regions,
        strange as that may seem. The short, hot
        summers of the Alaskan peninsula, where
        the temperature rises at times to ninety
        degrees or over, and an abundant and
        beautifully colored vegetational growth
        springs up, are well known. For eighty
        four days, from May 10 to August 3, in
        north polar regions the intensity of the
        light and heat received from the sun is
        greater than it is at the equator.
        On Mars this period of greater in
        tensity of light and heat in polar regions
        over that of equatorial regions is 16f
        days. In the Martian summer in polai
        regions there would be a less extreme
        range of daily temperature than that at
        the Martian equator," and in the long, in
        tensely cold polar Winter hibernation
        would insure the survival of life. On
        Mars, as on our own planet, life would
        undoubtedly adapt itself to its environ
        ment. If we knew only of life in equa
        torial regions how inconceivable it would
        be that life could exist near the poles!
        One" of the strongest arguments in
        favor of the probable existence of life on
        Mars is the decided greenish tinge that is
        seen to spread over the dark markings of
        the planet’s surface and deepen in color
        with the advance of Spring. This beauti
        ful color change on the surface of the
        planet was noted and remarked upon at
        the opposition of 1924 as at past opposi
        tions, and to attempt to explain it as due
        to other than the seasonal spread of vege
        tational growth seems futile.
        The problem of the canals of Mars we
        have always with us. Have they an ob
        jective reality? Are they strips of vege
        tation bordering waterways, made by
        intelligent beings to conserve a scanty
        water supply that is dependent on the
        melting polar cap in the absence of large
        oceans, seas or lakes? Or are they simply
        ’ optical illusions,” as some astronomers
        still maintain? Are they possibly vegeta
        tional growth lying in the path of
        moisture-ladened air curre .a, ps Prof.
        W. H. Pickering, one of the most assidu
        ous and noted observers of Mars, once
        suggested ?
        There are, how.ever, some astronomers
        at the Mt. Wilson and Yerkes Observatory
        and elsewhere who still fail to detect any
        of the fine thread-like markings that have
        caused so much discussion, although these
        astronomers find a wealth of other detail
        and color changes on the faces of the
        ruddy planet.
        The transitory appearance of greatly
        extended cloud areas, fogs, mists anil
        snowstorms on Mars are now so well
        known and so generally observed that
        there is no longer any question of their
        existence. They furnish additional proof
        of the existence of moisture in the atmos
        phere of Mars which is also indicated by
        the seasonal melting of the polar snow
        caps ami the appearance of the greatly
        extended bright regions over the polar
        regions in the ultra-violet photographs of
        the planet’s atmosphere taken at the Lick
        Observatory.
        Here, then, is a little world in space,
        coming at times within a distance of
        thirty-five million miles or so of our own
        planet, that we have reason to believe
        may be inhabited by as many varied forms
        of life as is our own planet. Yet the
        forms of life that exist on Mars may be
        strange and weird beyond our power to
        imagine, owing to the great difference in
        the composition and density of their at
        mospheres, which is as important a factor
        in the lives of growing organisms as the
        light and heat that is obtained from the
        sun.
        The three essentials to the dcvolpment
        of life—air, water and a temperature
        above the freezing point for reasonably
        long periods—are to be found on Mars
        as they are on our own planet, Earth. It
        is but reasonable to assume that under
        such circumstances life would develop on
        Mars as it has on our planet, though
        adapted to its own peculiar environment.

        He wants to be the first to announce
        the exact state of civilization on Mars,
        if civilization exists; he wants to be
        the first to settle once and for all the
        problems which baffled Galileo and
        the first telescope in 1610—whether
        or not life can exist, has existed and
        does exist on Mars. He will be able to
        say with absolute finality whether the

        been seen in the past through such
        giant glasses as the Mount Wilson, Cal.,
        telescope, which Dr. Ritchey also de
        signed—the largest in the world. There

        Astounding Metal Mirrors, Developed
        in Secret and Ushering in a New
        Telescopic Era.
        mirrors are of course the key of the
        telescopic principle. Now C. H. Lutz,
        an associate of Dr. Ritchey, has de
        veloped an all-metal mirror at his New
        Jersey metallurgical laboratory. It will
        not tarnish nor react to weather or
        temperature. In the past a 200-inch
        mirror was the limit of practicability.
        The metal mirrors may be made of any
        diameter.
        Dr. Ritchey is hurrying preparations
        with all speed consistent with scien
        tific exactitude. He' knows, even better
        than the layman can imagine in his
        fevered dreams, what wonders—per

        projects, weird monuments—may flash
        from thd great mirrors when they are

        Feminine Necessities!—Mrs. Walker’s
        Makeshift Makeup Kit.
        TWO friends, calling on Mrs. Mary
        J. Walker, who presides over
        an imposing 13-room mansion in
        Pittsburgh’s fashionable East End, are
        asked to sit down. But Mrs. Walker,
        the hostess, must stand during the visit;
        and if there are three friends in the
        party, one of them must stand, too.
        The furnishings of this sumptuous
        dwelling—one of Pittsburgh’s show
        palaces — consist of two chain, one
        bare mattress, a radiator-top desk and
        one canary named “Dickie.” Mrs.
        Walker, who once had servants to at
        tend' her amid rich rugs and costly an
        tiques in this same house, now car
        ries on the routine of life in the dig
        nified, somewhat Spartan simplicity of
        a home scraped to tho bone by unsym
        pathetic moving men.
        Mrs. Walker is neither a victim of
        the depression nor an eccentric ad
        vocate of the Simple Life. A wrecked
        marriage and the bitterness which fol
        lowed left Mrs. Walker stranded on the
        shoals of her own determination not
        to give in, no matter what.
        Once upon a time John L. Walker,
        confidential secretary to the Lockhart-
        Mason estate and to Henry Lee Mason,
        wealthy philanthropist, occupied the
        house with Mrs. Walker and two
        daughters by his first marriage. They

        eighteen degrees south of the Equator
        in a suitable spot, while the fifth will
        peer up from the far, frozen South.
        Thus the richest sector of the uni
        verse will be swept. These five tre
        mendous eyes will hunt the heavens
        like batteries of big guns trained upon
        mysteries long inviolate. The results
        may well explode upon man’s conscious
        ness, in city and jungle, from news
        paper headlines and fast couriers.
        “With my mirrors,” says Dr. Ritchey,
        “photographs will be made that will
        show craters 70 feet in diameter and
        any object on Mars two miles in dia
        meter will be clearly defined.”
        Those mirrors are like great, glit
        ering honeycombs—what science calls
        the cellular construction. Several at dif
        ferent angles on each telescope catch
        and toss the light reflected from the
        far-off world—passing it from one to
        another like some robot basketball
        team until it is ready for the focus
        ing mirror and the eye of the camera
        or the astronomer.
        The controversy about the possibil
        ity of life on Mars has been fanned

        Walker’s friction with his two chil

        Mra Walker promptly appealed the
        case, but the State Superior Court up
        held the divorce. Walker suggested
        that he had no further obligations to
        ward her; that she should therefore
        move, take herself thence, in short,
        “scram.”
        These things, singly and collectively,
        Mrs. Walker refused to do. Mr. Walker
        retaliated by obtaining a writ empower
        ing him to remove the furniture. Out
        went the furniture, every stick of it,
        along with everything movable in the
        house—but in stayed Mrs. Walker.

        to new life by the prospect of this
        amazing telescopic artillery in the
        hands of science. Sir William Herschel,
        the English astronomer, was the first
        exponent of the life-on-Mars theory to
        gain international attention. But even
        in the vortex of the argument—which
        grew heated, with uncomplimentary
        epithets exchanged among proponents
        of and scoffers at the theory—the
        most sanguine investigator would shake
        his head now and again, sighing: “After
        all, we’ll never know!”
        Now, thanks to Dr. Ritchey, we WILL
        know! If the answer la yes—if those
        monster mirrors reflect irrefutable
        evidence of life on the planet, the news
        will bring to the Herschelites who have
        long pointed out that Mars affords the
        requisites of life: heat, water and oxy
        gen. They will recall how they placed
        m evidence the regular, criss-cross
        markings on the planet, which seemed
        to serve some purpose and to have
        been planned.
        "Mars is a sterile planet," retorted
        the more conservative scientists. "The
        so-called canala are voleanie cracks.”
        But they could not deny that Mara
        faced the aun at much the same angle
        as the earth. They could not dispute
        the rhythm of seasons upon Mars, nor
        the poles sheathed in ice like ours, nor
        Mars frigid, temperate and torrid
        zones. Nor the absence of rivers, seas
        and lakes upon Mars—with the ne
        cessity for some kind of irrigation like
        those canals.
        Dr. Ritchey is not to vain im
        aginings and speculations. But he ad

        city, if cities exist there. The new ones
        may be able to show a building as tall
        as the Empire State in sharp relief
        and will give the architects of the fu
        ture, it may well be, precepts to numb
        the imagination.
        Writers since the dawn of astronomy
        as a science have woven tales around
        the possible inhabitants of Mars. Edgar
        Rice Burroughs laid several of his fast
        moving romances on the Red Planet,
        endowing its inhabitants with bestial
        horror in some cases and intellectual
        superiority in others. He is only one
        of a multitude of story-tellers, in
        cluding H. G. Wells, who have de
        scribed the citizens of Mars. The rule
        has been to make them super-human,
        builders of a civilization many times
        more ancient and advanced than ours.
        The tendency of scientists has been
        to postulate a type of life on Mars, if
        there is, much lower than ours—beings
        twisted by environment into grotesque
        shapes, mentally undeveloped because
        of the need of using all vital resources
        in the combat against alternating sub
        zero cold and sizzling heat when the
        ice caps melt once a year and sluice
        the Martian valleys. The year on Mars
        is 687 days long.
        Charles G. Fort, a strange man
        who led a hermit-like existence in New
        York, wrote books in which newspaper
        clippings describing startling and unex
        plained phenomena were adduced to
        suggest visitations from other planets
        to Earth. He got a good deal es sur
        prised attention in some quarters. One
        of his items described a Martian visi

        HAIL TO MARS!
        By Garrett P. Serviss
        Salutations to the earth’s <
        brother. Mars! He enters
        with high credentials into the
        restricted elrcle of inhabited
        worlds, Prof. Henry- Norris Rus
        sell, the successor of Prof. Charles
        A. Young at Princeton Observa
        tory, and one of the foremost
        figures in modern astronomy, has
        declared his belief that there is
        life on Mars. Heretofore he be
        lieved that life did not exist on
        any of the planets except the
        earth; now he believes that there
        Is at least vegetable life on Mars,
        and that there are many other
        inhabited planets in the universe.
        He has made this announcement
        to his students.
        The spirits of Giovanni Schiap
        arelli, Camille Flammarion and
        Percival Lowell may rejoice. The
        great cause for which they con
        tended is triumphing. They held
        that the first duty of astronomers
        Is to study the worlds immedi
        ately around us, in our own
        solar system, with a view to as
        certain whether they are occupied
        by living beings. But, instead
        of receiving universal hearty sup
        port and aid from their brethren
        in astronomy they were, in too
        many cases, doubted, regarded
        with a shrug, called in question
        as to the accuracy of their ob
        servations and statements and
        even sneered at because, for
        sooth, they Interested the pub
        lic. For that they were treated
        as sensation mongers and dream
        ers.
        Professor Russell was never
        one of these accusers, though he
        remained skeptical. He was open
        minded, waiting only for what he
        could regard as conclusive facts.
        Now he has found enough of
        such facts to change Ills mind,
        and having changed it, he tells
        his students, not being afraid of
        human interest, nor regarding its
        absence as a sine qua non in
        scientific communications.
        Professor Russell’s cau ti on
        shown in limiting his belief, for
        the present, to vegetable life on
        Mars, is an index of his sincerity.
        But knowing, as we do, that the
        distinction between vegetable and
        animal life is practically imper
        ceptible when we go far enough
        back, it would seem that the case
        for the habitability of Mars is
        established when the existence of
        vegetation on Its surface is ad
        mitted.
        And with the vegetation there i
        are clouds, and mists, and prob
        ably rains; also advancing and re
        treating snow caps about the
        poles, variations of temperature
        between morning, midday and
        life like a novice qn a bicycle,
        simply HUNTING for the jolts.
        As long as the world continues,
        old men will marry flappers,
        young men will fall in love with
        hard-eyed vamps, and sane, in
        telligent men will fall for brain
        less flirts and gold-diggers.
        There is ne help FOR them?
        ► evening. and many other char*
        aeteristics of a living world.
        It is regrettable that Prof. Rus
        sell does not admit simlliar evi
        dence of the presence of life on
        Venus. His skepticism with re
        gard to that beautiful planet
        seems to rest upon the failure of
        certain investigators to detect
        oxygen in its atmosphere. But
        this failure cannot be regarded
        as a decisive test.
        The circumstances under which
        Venus is observed with our tele
        scopes and other instruments are
        quite different from those affect
        ing Mars. The latter presents
        the whole of its surface plainly
        to the view of telescopes, except
        where portions are obscured by
        clouds. But Venus is entirely en
        veloped with clouds, and it is
        doubtful if any part of her real
        surface is ever visible to us. But
        her atmosphere is deep and
        abundant, and the cloud region
        probably lies higher than on the
        earth, so that the under portion
        of the atmosphere of Venus,
        which we never see, is profound.
        It may well be that the presence
        of oxygen is not detected because
        enough of that element does not
        exist in the higher regions of the
        atmosphere to record its presence
        on our instruments. In almost all
        respects, Venus seems a more
        suitable abode for life than Mara.
        Watch her now glowing so bril
        liantly in the sunset sky and
        greet her, too, as a sister of the
        earth well worthy to rank with
        her brother Mars among the
        “abodes of life** surrounding the
        sun. There are not too many of
        them and they are far away from
        the great centers of the s'arry
        universe; little islets in the in
        finite ocean of space, with only
        an underclass sun to Illuminate
        them.

        Thinking Veg
        etable of Mars
        (New York American.
        Mars is the nearest planet to us,
        the one which we can see the most
        plainly and the first, one which we
        shall be able to visit when science
        makes a journey beyond our atmos
        phere possible.
        Mars, moreover, is proved by as
        tronomy to possess air atmosphere
        and to be capable of supporting life
        in some form.
        These facts make it natural that
        scientists and writers should specu
        late upon the character of the life
        upon Mars. It must as yet be specu
        lation, for our means of seeing only
        enable us to distinguish objects sev
        eral miles in extent upon the planet.

        interesting theories about the
        life of Mars have been put forward,
        but all of them have been open to
        some objection. Prof. Percival Lowell
        of the Flagstaff observatory in Ari
        zona. has argued that the so-calle
        canals of Mars are vast engineering
        works, and consequently that the in
        habitants who built them were oi
        great intellectual development. The
        scientific novelist. H. G. Wells, has
        built an extremely interesting story
        on the basis- that Martians are octo
        pus-like creatures, without bonv struc
        ture. but possessed of highly developed
        brains. A common assumption of
        many speculators has been that the
        Martians are extremely attenuated
        creatures, because the slight pressure
        of gravity on the surface of the
        planet would favor this form.
        ..ow
        new and
        exceedingly inter­
        esting theory concerning the life of
        has been put forward by Prof.
        William Wallace Campbell of the
        great Lick observatory. California. He
        suggests that all life on Mars has
        taken a vegetable form.
        Thistheory is one of the most plau
        sible that has been put forward. It
        has the support of all the facts about
        Jf? have been scientifically es
        tablished, and it avoids many of the
        improbabilities involved in other
        theories on the same subject.
        The vegetation theory rests pri
        marily on the fact proved by spectro
        scopic analysis that there is an enor
        mous proportion of carbonic acid gas
        in the atmosphere of Mars, which
        would make animal life of the kind
        Known to the earth exceedingly diffi
        cult, if not impossible, while It would
        greatly favor the development of
        vegetat'in.
        Before considering this theory fur
        tner, we must bear in mind a few of
        the proved facts about Mar?, it is
        atmosphere, seasons, land, witvr.
        storms, clouds and mountains. It
        also rains and snowg on Mars, as It
        does with us. Great white patches
        appear periodically upon its surface.
        may be accumulations of snow
        2"® they have also been called "eves.'
        "heir nature will be discussed later.
        When Mars approaches nearest to
        the earth It Is seen to have a bright
        red color and sometimes looks like a
        red lamp in the sky. It has been sug
        gested that the vegetation for the
        most part i8 yellow or orange instead
        of green, as with us. thus giving the
        planet its color.
        Mars has two moons, the nearest of
        which is about 3,700 miles away and
        revolves around the planet in seven
        hours and a half, showing all the
        Phases of our moon in one night.
        The density and size of Mars are
        ess than those of the earth, and con
        sequently a man who weighed 200
        pounds here would only weigh "5
        pounds up there.
        The atmosphere and moisture of
        Mars are very slight, and the inhabi
        tants, if there be any. must find life
        a difficult problem there. The water
        Is confined entirely to the poles, where
        it is deposited annually In the form
        of a tntn layer of snow or hoar frost.

        Prof. Lovell has argued that the
        canals of Mars, first discovered bv
        Prof. Schiaparelli of Milan, but long
        considered optical illusions bv astron
        omers. are the irrigation works of the
        inhabitants. The canals are singular
        ly artificial in appearance. They ex
        tend toward the equator from the
        poles and cover the planet like a fine
        neting.
        Each canal is the shortest distance
        between two points and invariably
        runs to a point called an "oasis,"
        where it meets other canals, not in
        haphazard fashion, but according to
        some plan.
        The canals vary in length from 250
        miles to over 3,000 miles, a' length
        that is astonishing when it is con
        sidered .that the diameter of Mare is
        only 4.220 miles. All told. Prof. Nov
        ell has plotted 437 of these canals and
        186 oases. It was Prof. Pickering, a
        close associate of Prof. Lowell, who
        first saw these oases.
        The canals of Mars appear and dis
        appear with the seasons. In other
        words, they slowly creep down from
        the poles each spring and slowiv re
        treat with the approach of winter.
        If the canals are artificial in origin,
        this phenomenon would appear to
        mean that the- Martians are busilv
        engaged in digging stupendous canals,
        only to fill them up again every year.
        Prof. Pickering ingeniously avoided
        this embarrassing conclusion by point
        ing out that we see not the canals
        themselves, but the vegetation which
        fringes their .banks and thus indicates
        their course. Vegetation must grow
        before the canals are visible, and
        must disappear before the canals
        vanish.
        Here we can see why the theory
        that all the life on Mars Is vegetation
        is more probable than any other.
        Prof. Pickering admits that the signs
        of life we see are vegetable, but sug
        gests that they are the work of man
        like creatures whom we cannot see.
        But we know that it would be almost
        Impossible for man-like creatures' to
        live there, tl is most, likely, then,
        that veegtation is the only life.
        From our knowledge of life on the
        earth It is quiet conceivable that the
        highest type of Intelligence might
        dwell in a plant, as plants that we
        know possess more or less Intelli
        gence. and the fact that th'ey mav
        not possess the highest kind is due
        to conditions on the earth which do
        not exist on Mars.
        The original germ Of life on earth
        was neither animal nor vegetable.
        Many stages of development passed
        before the two forms of life became
        separated. Low in the scale of life
        we now see many forms-of which It
        cannot be said positively that they
        are animal or vegetable. When dis
        ease bacteria were first observed it
        was believed that they were animal,
        but now the pervalllng view Is that
        they are vegetable. Yet they possess
        the power of motion generally char
        acteristic of animals.
        One of the great differences be
        tween plants and animals Is that the
        former have not a brain and nervous
        system which can be compared to
        that pf the latter. The life of the
        plant resides in Its separate cells, and
        they are only held, together by their
        juxtaposition to one another and not
        controlled by a central system.
        The people of the state of Washing
        ton are accustomed to call the moun
        tains in the Puget Sound section' "The
        Alps of America." but they were act
        ually surprised last week when a
        Swiss, E. Schmldhelng of St. Gall,
        Switzerland, said: "The Alps of Amer
        ica possess the rugged grandeur of
        the Alps of Switzerland, which at
        tract thousands of American visitors
        each year."'
        vj*
        the
        advent of summer.
        Ages ago life on Mars must have
        concentrated Itself on the problem of
        devising some means whereby the
        melting water of the polar parts might
        be conducted to those arid regions of
        temperate and torrid zones,
        which would still blossom if watered.
        Here we may note one of the strong
        est arguments in favor of the vegeta
        tion- theory of life.
